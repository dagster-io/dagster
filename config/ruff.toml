# ########################
# ##### RUFF - CANONICAL SHARED CONFIGURATION
# ########################
#
# This is the canonical shared ruff configuration for the Dagster codebase.
# Both the OSS repo (dagster-oss/) and the internal repo extend this file.
#
# NOTE: This file lives in config/ subdirectory to prevent ruff from
# auto-discovering it. Ruff looks for ruff.toml in the project root, and if
# found, would bypass the per-file-ignores in pyproject.toml.
#
# To override settings:
#   - Add `extend = "./config/ruff.toml"` (for OSS) or `extend = "dagster-oss/config/ruff.toml"` (for internal)
#   - Override specific settings in [tool.ruff] sections
#
# [Docs root]
#   https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/
# [Config option reference]
#   https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/

# Target lowest supported Python version.
target-version = "py310"

# Codebase-wide default line length. Override in package-specific pyproject.toml where a different
# length is desired.
line-length = 100

# Fail if Ruff is not running this version.
required-version = "0.15.0"

  # (missing public docstrings) These work off of the Python sense of "public", rather than our
  # bespoke definition based off of `@public`. When ruff supports custom plugins then we can write
  # appropriate rules to require docstrings for `@public`.

  # (docstring imperative mood) Overly restrictive.
  "D401",

  # (module level import not at top) There are several places where we use e.g.
  # warnings.filterwarings calls before imports.
  "E402",

  # (line too long): This fires for comments, which the ruff formatter won't auto-wrap. Disabling
  # until there is an autoformat solution available for comments.
  "E501",

  # (no type comparison): There are a few places where we use `== type(None)` which are more clear
  # than the equivalent `isinstance` check.
  'E721',

  # (bare exception): There are many places where we want to catch a maximally generic exception.
  'E722',

  # (no assign lambda): existing code assigns lambdas in a few places. With ruff formatting
  # requiring extra empty lines between defs, disallowing lambda assignment can make code less
  # readable.
  "E731",

  # (try-except-in-loop) we use this pattern in many places and the performance impact is negligible

  # (no concatenation) Existing codebase has many concatentations, no reason to disallow them.

  # (use ClassVar for attr declarations with defaults) This is a good rule for vanilla Python, but
  # triggers false positives for many libs that have DSLs that make use of attr defaults.

  # right now, but we should enable after fixing the violations.

  # (assorted perf rules) We have a lot of violations, enable when autofix is available
  "PERF401", # (manual-list-comprehension)
  "PERF402", # (manual-list-copy)

  # (pyupgrade) Keep using Optional[] syntax to avoid excessive changes.
  # Will be enabled in later phases of the ruff unification objective.
  # See: https://github.com/dagster-io/internal/issues/20346
  "UP045",  # (non-pep604-annotation) Use X | None for Optional types

  # (private member access) Flag access to `_`-prefixed symbols. By default the various special
  # methods on `NamedTuple` are ignored (e.g. `_replace`).

  # (flake8-type-checking) Auto-sort imports into TYPE_CHECKING blocks depending on whether
  # they are runtime or type-only imports.
