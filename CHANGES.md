# Changelog

## 0.7.0

**Breaking**

- `dagster.Set` and `dagster.Tuple` can no longer be used within the config system.
- The implementation of SQL-based event log storages has been consolidated,
  which has entailed a schema change. If you have event logs stored in a
  Postgres- or SQLite-backed event log storage, and you would like to maintain
  access to these logs, you should run `dagster instance migrate`. To check
  what event log storages you are using, run `dagster instance info`.

## 0.6.6

**Breaking**

- The `selector` argument to `PipelineDefinition` has been removed. This API made it possible to
  construct a `PipelineDefinition` in an invalid state. Use `PipelineDefinition.build_sub_pipeline`
  instead.

**New**

- Added the `dagster_prometheus` library, which exposes a basic Prometheus resource.
- Dagster Airflow DAGs may now use GCS instead of S3 for storage.
- Expanded interface for schedule management in Dagit.

**Dagit**

- Performance improvements when loading, displaying, and editing config for large pipelines.
- Smooth scrolling zoom in the explore tab replaces the previous two-step zoom.
- No longer depends on internet fonts to run, allowing fully offline dev.
- Typeahead behavior in search has improved.
- Invocations of composite solids remain visible in the sidebar when the solid is expanded.
- The config schema panel now appears when the config editor is first opened.
- Interface now includes hints for autocompletion in the config editor.
- Improved display of solid inputs and output in the explore tab.
- Provides visual feedback while filter results are loading.
- Better handling of pipelines that aren't present in the currently loaded repo.

**Bugfix**

- Dagster Airflow DAGs previously could crash while handling Python errors in DAG logic.
- Step failures when running Dagster Airflow DAGs were previously not being surfaced as task
  failures in Airflow.
- Dagit could previously get into an invalid state when switching pipelines in the context of a
  solid subselection.
- `frozenlist` and `frozendict` now pass Dagster's parameter type checks for `list` and `dict`.
- The GraphQL playground in Dagit is now working again.

**Nits**

- Dagit now prints its pid when it loads.
- Third-party dependencies have been relaxed to reduce the risk of version conflicts.
- Improvements to docs and example code.

## 0.6.5

**Breaking**

- The interface for type checks has changed. Previously the `type_check_fn` on a custom type was
  required to return None (=passed) or else raise `Failure` (=failed). Now, a `type_check_fn` may
  return `True`/`False` to indicate success/failure in the ordinary case, or else return a
  `TypeCheck`. The new`success` field on `TypeCheck` now indicates success/failure. This obviates
  the need for the `typecheck_metadata_fn`, which has been removed.
- Executions of individual composite solids (e.g. in test) now produce a
  `CompositeSolidExecutionResult` rather than a `SolidExecutionResult`.
- `dagster.core.storage.sqlite_run_storage.SqliteRunStorage` has moved to
  `dagster.core.storage.runs.SqliteRunStorage`. Any persisted `dagster.yaml` files should be updated
  with the new classpath.
- `is_secret` has been removed from `Field`. It was not being used to any effect.
- The `environmentType` and `configTypes` fields have been removed from the dagster-graphql
  `Pipeline` type. The `configDefinition` field on `SolidDefinition` has been renamed to
  `configField`.

**Bugfix**

- `PresetDefinition.from_files` is now guaranteed to give identical results across all Python
  minor versions.
- Nested composite solids with no config, but with config mapping functions, now behave as expected.
- The dagster-airflow `DagsterKubernetesPodOperator` has been fixed.
- Dagit is more robust to changes in repositories.
- Improvements to Dagit interface.

**New**

- dagster_pyspark now supports remote execution on EMR with the `@pyspark_solid` decorator.

**Nits**

- Documentation has been improved.
- The top level config field `features` in the `dagster.yaml` will no longer have any effect.
- Third-party dependencies have been relaxed to reduce the risk of version conflicts.

## 0.6.4

- Scheduler errors are now visible in dagit
- Run termination button no longer persists past execution completion
- Fixes run termination for multiprocess execution
- Fixes run termination on Windows
- `dagit` no longer prematurely returns control to terminal on Windows
- `raise_on_error` is now available on the `execute_solid` test utility
- `check_dagster_type` added as a utility to help test type checks on custom types
- Improved support in the type system for `Set` and `Tuple` types
- Allow composite solids with config mapping to expose an empty config schema
- Simplified graphql API arguments to single-step re-execution to use `retryRunId`, `stepKeys` execution parameters instead of a `reexecutionConfig` input object
- Fixes missing step-level stdout/stderr from dagster CLI

## 0.6.3

- Adds a `type_check` parameter to `PythonObjectType`, `as_dagster_type`, and `@as_dagster_type` to enable custom
  type checks in place of default `isinstance` checks.
  See documentation here: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/learn/tutorial/types.html#custom-type-checks
- Improved the type inference experience by automatically wrapping bare python types as dagster types.
- Reworked our tutorial (now with more compelling/scary breakfast cereal examples) and public API documentation.
  See the new tutorial here: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sections/learn/tutorial/index.html
- New solids explorer in Dagit allows you to browse and search for solids used across the repository.

- Enabled solid dependency selection in the Dagit search filter.

  - To select a solid and its upstream dependencies, search `+{solid_name}`.
  - To select a solid and its downstream dependents, search `{solid_name}+`.
  - For both search `+{solid_name}+`.

  For example. In the Airline demo, searching `+join_q2_data` will get the following:

- Added a terminate button in Dagit to terminate an active run.

  ![Stop Button](./screenshots/stop_button.png)

- Added an `--output` flag to `dagster-graphql` CLI.
- Added confirmation step for `dagster run wipe` and `dagster schedule wipe` commands (Thanks @shahvineet98).
- Fixed a wrong title in the `dagster-snowflake` library README (Thanks @Step2Web).

## 0.6.2

- Changed composition functions `@pipeline` and `@composite_solid` to automatically give solids
  aliases with an incrementing integer suffix when there are conflicts. This removes to the need
  to manually alias solid definitions that are used multiple times.
- Add `dagster schedule wipe` command to delete all schedules and remove all schedule cron jobs
- `execute_solid` test util now works on composite solids.
- Docs and example improvements: https://dagster.readthedocs.io/
- Added `--remote` flag to `dagster-graphql` for querying remote dagit servers.
- Fixed issue with duplicate run tag autocomplete suggestions in dagit (#1839)
- Fixed Windows 10 / py3.6+ bug causing pipeline execution failures

## 0.6.1

- Fixed an issue where Dagster public images tagged `latest` on Docker Hub were erroneously
  published with an older version of Dagster (#1814)
- Fixed an issue where the most recent scheduled run was not displayed in dagit (#1815)
- Fixed a bug with the `dagster schedule start --start-all` command (#1812)
- Added a new scheduler command to restart a schedule: `dagster schedule restart`. Also added a
  flag to restart all running schedules: `dagster schedule restart --restart-all-running`.

## 0.6.0

**New**

This major release includes features for scheduling, operating, and executing pipelines
that elevate dagit and dagster from a local development tool to a deployable service.

- `DagsterInstance` introduced as centralized system to control run, event, compute log,
  and local intermediates storage.
- A `Scheduler` abstraction has been introduced along side an initial implementation of
  `SystemCronScheduler` in `dagster-cron`.
- `dagster-aws` has been extended with a CLI for deploying dagster to AWS. This can spin
  up a Dagit node and all the supporting infrastructure—security group, RDS PostgreSQL
  instance, etc.—without having to touch the AWS console, and for deploying your code
  to that instance.
- **Dagit**
  - `Runs`: a completely overhauled Runs history page. Includes the ability to `Retry`,
    `Cancel`, and `Delete` pipeline runs from the new runs page.
  - `Scheduler`: a page for viewing and interacting with schedules.
  - `Compute Logs`: stdout and stderr are now viewable on a per execution step basis in each run.
    This is available in real time for currently executing runs and for historical runs.
  - A `Reload` button in the top right in dagit restarts the web-server process and updates
    the UI to reflect repo changes, including DAG structure, solid names, type names, etc.
    This replaces the previous file system watching behavior.

**Breaking Changes**

- `--log` and `--log-dir` no longer supported as CLI args. Existing runs and events stored
  via these flags are no longer compatible with current storage.
- `raise_on_error` moved from in process executor config to argument to arguments in
  python API methods such as `execute_pipeline`

## 0.5.9

- Fixes an issue using custom types for fan-in dependencies with intermediate storage.

## 0.5.8

- Fixes an issue running some Dagstermill notebooks on Windows.
- Fixes a transitive dependency issue with Airflow.
- Bugfixes, performance improvements, and better documentation.

## 0.5.7

- Fixed an issue with specifying composite output mappings (#1674)
- Added support for specifying
  [Dask worker resources](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/resources.html) (#1679)
- Fixed an issue with launching Dagit on Windows

## 0.5.6

- Execution details are now configurable. The new top-level `ExecutorDefinition` and `@executor`
  APIs are used to define in-process, multiprocess, and Dask executors, and may be used by users to
  define new executors. Like loggers and storage, executors may be added to a `ModeDefinition` and
  may be selected and configured through the `execution` field in the environment dict or YAML,
  including through Dagit. Executors may no longer be configured through the `RunConfig`.
- The API of dagster-dask has changed. Pipelines are now executed on Dask using the
  ordinary `execute_pipeline` API, and the Dask executor is configured through the environment.
  (See the dagster-dask README for details.)
- Added the `PresetDefinition.from_files` API for constructing a preset from a list of environment
  files (replacing the old usage of this class). `PresetDefinition` may now be directly
  instantiated with an environment dict.
- Added a prototype integration with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/).
- Added a prototype integration with [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/).
- Added a prototype integration with [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/).
- Added the dagster-bash library.
- Added the dagster-ssh library.
- Added the dagster-sftp library.
- Loosened the PyYAML compatibility requirement.
- The dagster CLI no longer takes a `--raise-on-error` or `--no-raise-on-error` flag. Set this
  option in executor config.
- Added a `MarkdownMetadataEntryData` class, so events yielded from client code may now render
  markdown in their metadata.
- Bug fixes, documentation improvements, and improvements to error display.

## 0.5.5

- Dagit now accepts parameters via environment variables prefixed with `DAGIT_`, e.g. `DAGIT_PORT`.
- Fixes an issue with reexecuting Dagstermill notebooks from Dagit.
- Bug fixes and display improvments in Dagit.

## 0.5.4

- Reworked the display of structured log information and system events in Dagit, including support
  for structured rendering of client-provided event metadata.
- Dagster now generates events when intermediates are written to filesystem and S3 storage, and
  these events are displayed in Dagit and exposed in the GraphQL API.
- Whitespace display styling in Dagit can now be toggled on and off.
- Bug fixes, display nits and improvements, and improvements to JS build process, including better
  display for some classes of errors in Dagit and improvements to the config editor in Dagit.

## 0.5.3

- Pinned RxPY to 1.6.1 to avoid breaking changes in 3.0.0 (py3-only).
- Most definition objects are now read-only, with getters corresponding to the previous properties.
- The `valueRepr` field has been removed from `ExecutionStepInputEvent` and `ExecutionStepOutputEvent`.
- Bug fixes and dagit UX improvements, including SQL highlighting and error handling.

## 0.5.2

- Added top-level `define_python_dagster_type` function.
- Renamed `metadata_fn` to `typecheck_metadata_fn` in all runtime type creation APIs.
- Renamed `result_value` and `result_values` to `output_value` and `output_values` on `SolidExecutionResult`
- Dagstermill: Reworked public API now contains only `define_dagstermill_solid`, `get_context`,
  `yield_event`, `yield_result`, `DagstermillExecutionContext`, `DagstermillError`, and
  `DagstermillExecutionError`. Please see the new
  [guide](https://dagster.readthedocs.io/en/0.5.2/sections/learn/guides/data_science/data_science.html)
  for details.
- Bug fixes, including failures for some dagster CLI invocations and incorrect handling of Airflow
  timestamps.
