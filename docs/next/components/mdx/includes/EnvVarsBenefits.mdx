Using the `EnvVar` approach has a few unique benefits:

- **Improved observability.** The UI will display information about configuration values sourced from environment variables.
- **Secret values are hidden in the UI.** Secret values are hidden in the Launchpaid, **Resources** page, and other places where configuration is displayed.
- **Simplified testing.** Because you can provide string values directly to configuration rather than environment variables, testing may be easier.
