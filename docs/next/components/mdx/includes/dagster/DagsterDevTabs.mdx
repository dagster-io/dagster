Dagster can load a file directly as a code location. In the following example, we used the `-f` argument to supply the name of the file:

```shell
dagster dev -f my_file.py
```

This command loads the definitions in `my_file.py` as a code location in the current Python environment.

You can also include multiple files at a time, where each file will be loaded as a code location:

```shell
dagster dev -f my_file.py -f my_second_file.py
```

Dagster can also load Python modules as [code locations](/concepts/code-locations). When this approach is used, Dagster loads the definitions defined in the module passed to the command line.

We recommend defining a variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in a submodule named `definitions` inside the Python module. In practice, the submodule can be created by adding a file named `definitions.py` at the root level of the Python module.

As this style of development eliminates an entire class of Python import errors, we strongly recommend it for Dagster projects deployed to production.

In the following example, we used the `-m` argument to supply the name of the module and where to find the definitions:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name.definitions
```

This command loads the definitions in the variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in the `definitions` submodule in the current Python environment.

You can also include multiple modules at a time, where each module will be loaded as a code location:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name.definitions -m your_second_module.definitions
```

<TabItem name="Without command line arguments">

To load definitions without supplying command line arguments, you can use the `pyproject.toml` file. This file, included in all Dagster example projects, contains a `tool.dagster` section with a `module_name` variable:

```toml
[tool.dagster]
module_name = "your_module_name.definitions"  ## name of project's Python module and where to find the definitions
code_location_name = "your_code_location_name"  ## optional, name of code location to display in the Dagster UI
```

When defined, you can run this in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file:

```shell
dagster dev
```

Instead of this:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name.definitions
```

You can also include multiple modules at a time using the `pyproject.toml` file, where each module will be loaded as a code location:

```toml
[tool.dagster]
modules = [{ type = "module", name = "foo" }, { type = "module", name = "bar" }]
```
