Dagster’s [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) (SDAs) bear several similarities to dbt models. A software-defined asset contains an asset key, a set of upstream asset keys, and an operation that is responsible for computing the asset from its upstream dependencies. Models defined in a dbt project are similar to Dagster SDAs in that:

- The asset key for a dbt model is (by default) the name of the model.
- The upstream dependencies of a dbt model are defined with `ref` or `source` calls within the model's definition.
- The computation required to compute the asset from its upstream dependencies is the SQL within the model's definition.

These similarities make it natural to interact with dbt models as SDAs. Let’s take a look at a dbt model and an SDA, in code:

Here's what's happening in this example:

- The first code block is a **dbt model**
  - As dbt models are named using file names, this model is named `orders`
  - The data for this model comes from a dependency named `raw_orders`
- The second code block is a **Dagster asset**
  - The asset key corresponds to the name of the dbt model, `orders`
  - `raw_orders` is provided as an argument to the asset, defining it as a dependency
