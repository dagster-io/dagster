While you can use your existing production agent, we recommend creating a dedicated branch deployment agent. This ensures that your production instance isn't negatively impacted by the workload associated with branch deployments.

<details>
  <summary><strong>AMAZON ECS AGENTS</strong></summary>

1. **Deploy an ECS agent to serve your branch deployments**. Follow the [ECS agent](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents#amazon-ecs) setup guide, making sure to set the **Enable Branch Deployments** parameter if using the CloudFormation template. If you are running an existing agent, follow the [upgrade guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/upgrading-cloudformation-template) to ensure your template is up-to-date. Then, turn on the **Enable Branch Deployments** parameter.

2. **Create a private [Amazon Elastic Registry (ECR) repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).** Refer to the [AWS ECR documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-create.html) for instructions.

   After the repository has been created, navigate back to the list of [ECR repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

   In the list, locate the repository and its **URI**:

   src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/aws-ecr-uri.png"
   width={1086}
   height={159}
   />

3. [**Create an IAM user.**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) This user must:

   - Have push access to the ECR repository, and
   - Have programmatic access to AWS using an [access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)

   After the user is created, save the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** values shown on the confirmation page:

   <Image
   alt="Highlighted repository URI in the AWS ECR console"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/aws-iam-user-keys.png"
   width={999}
   height={420}
   />

  <summary><strong>DOCKER AGENTS</strong></summary>

1. Set up a new Docker agent. Refer to the [Docker agent setup guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker) for instructions.
2. After the agent is set up, modify the `dagster.yaml` file as follows:

   - Set the `dagster_cloud_api.branch_deployments` field to `true`
   - Remove any `deployment` field(s)

   For example:

   ```yaml
   # dagster.yaml

   instance_class:
     module: dagster_cloud.instance
     class: DagsterCloudAgentInstance

   dagster_cloud_api:
     agent_token: <YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN>
     branch_deployments: true ## true enables branch deployments

   user_code_launcher:
     module: dagster_cloud.workspace.docker
     class: DockerUserCodeLauncher
     config:
       networks:
         - dagster_cloud_agent
       server_ttl:
         enabled: true
         ttl_seconds: 7200 #2 hours
   ```

  <summary><strong>KUBERNETES AGENTS</strong></summary>

1. Set up a new Kubernetes agent. Refer to the [Kubernetes agent setup guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent) for instructions.

2. After the agent is set up, modify your Helm values file to include the following:

   ```yaml
   dagsterCloud:
     branchDeployments: true
   ---
   workspace:
     serverTTL:
       branchDeployments:
         ttlSeconds: 7200
   ```
