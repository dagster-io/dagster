# Advanced: Solid Re-use and Composition

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/" />

Abstracting business logic into reusable, configurable solids is one important step towards making data applications like other software applications.

## Reusable Solids

Solids are intended to abstract chunks of business logic, but abstractions aren't very meaningful unless they can be reused.

Our conditional outputs pipeline included a lot of repeated code—`sort_hot_cereals_by_calories` and `sort_cold_cereals_by_calories`, for instance. In general, it's preferable to build pipelines out of a relatively restricted set of well-tested library solids, using config liberally to parametrize them. You'll certainly have your own version of `read_csv`, for instance, and Dagster includes libraries like [`dagster_aws`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster_aws) and [`dagster_spark`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster_pyspark) to wrap and abstract interfaces with common third party tools.

Let's replace `sort_hot_cereals_by_calories` and `sort_cold_cereals_by_calories` by two aliases of the same library solid:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/reusable_solids.py startafter=start_reusable_solids_marker_0 endbefore=end_reusable_solids_marker_0
@solid(config_schema=String)
def sort_cereals_by_calories(context, cereals):
    sorted_cereals = sorted(
        cereals, key=lambda cereal: int(cereal["calories"])
    )
    context.log.info(
        "Least caloric {cereal_type} cereal: {least_caloric}".format(
            cereal_type=context.solid_config,
            least_caloric=sorted_cereals[0]["name"],
        )
    )


@pipeline
def reusable_solids_pipeline():
    hot_cereals, cold_cereals = split_cereals(read_csv())
    sort_hot_cereals = sort_cereals_by_calories.alias("sort_hot_cereals")
    sort_cold_cereals = sort_cereals_by_calories.alias("sort_cold_cereals")
    sort_hot_cereals(hot_cereals)
    sort_cold_cereals(cold_cereals)
```

You'll see that Dagit distinguishes between the two invocations of the single library solid and the solid's definition. The invocation is named and bound via a dependency graph to other invocations of other solids. The definition is the generic, reusable piece of logic that is invoked many times within this pipeline.

Configuring solids also uses the aliases, as in the following YAML:

```yaml file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/reusable_solids.yaml
solids:
  read_csv:
    inputs:
      csv_path:
        value: "cereal.csv"
  sort_cold_cereals:
    config: "cold"
  sort_hot_cereals:
    config: "hot"
```

## Composite Solids

The other basic facility that we expect from software in other domains is composability—the ability to combine building blocks into larger functional units.

Composite solids can be used to organize and refactor large or complicated pipelines, abstracting away complexity, as well as to wrap reusable general-purpose solids together with domain-specific logic.

As an example, let's compose two instances of a complex, general-purpose `read_csv` solid along with some domain-specific logic for the specific purpose of joining our cereal dataset with a lookup table providing human-readable names for the cereal manufacturers.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/composite_solids.py startafter=start_composite_solids_marker_0 endbefore=end_composite_solids_marker_0
@composite_solid
def load_cereals() -> DataFrame:
    read_cereals = read_csv.alias("read_cereals")
    read_manufacturers = read_csv.alias("read_manufacturers")
    return join_cereal(read_cereals(), read_manufacturers())
```

Defining a composite solid is similar to defining a pipeline, except that we use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="composite_solid" displayText="@composite_solid" /> decorator instead of <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" />. Dagit has sophisticated facilities for visualizing composite solids:

<Image
alt="composite_solids.png"
src="/images/tutorial/composite_solids.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

All of the complexity of the composite solid is hidden by default, but we can expand it at will by clicking into the solid (or on the "Expand" button in the right-hand pane):

<Image
alt="composite_solids_expanded.png"
src="/images/tutorial/composite_solids_expanded.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

Note the line indicating that the output of `join_cereal` is returned as the output of the composite solid as a whole.

Config for the individual solids making up the composite is nested, as follows:

```yaml file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/solids/composite_solids.yaml
solids:
  load_cereals:
    solids:
      read_cereals:
        inputs:
          csv_path:
            value: "cereal.csv"
      read_manufacturers:
        config:
          delimiter: ";"
        inputs:
          csv_path:
            value: "manufacturers.csv"
```

When we execute this pipeline, Dagit includes information about the nesting of individual execution steps within the composite:
