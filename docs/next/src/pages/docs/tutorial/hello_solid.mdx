# Hello, solid!

Let's write our first Dagster solid and save it as `hello_cereal.py`.

(You can also find this file, and all of the tutorial code, on [Github](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial) or,
if you've cloned the git repo, at `dagster/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/`.)

A solid is a unit of computation in a data pipeline. Typically, you'll define
solids by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator.

The logic in our first solid is very straightforward: it just reads in the csv
from a hardcoded path and logs the number of rows it finds.

```python literalinclude
file:/intro_tutorial/hello_cereal.py
caption:hello_cereal.py
lines:1-18
```

In this simplest case, our solid takes no inputs except for the <PyObject module="dagster" object="SystemComputeExecutionContext" displayText="context" /> in
which it executes (provided by the Dagster framework as the first argument
to every solid), and also returns no outputs. Don't worry, we'll soon encounter
solids that are much more dynamic.
