# Tutorial

If you're new to Dagster, we recommend working through this tutorial to become
familiar with Dagster's feature set and tooling, using small examples that are
intended to be illustrative of real data problems.

## Before We Start

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- [**Setup for the Tutorial**](/docs/tutorial/setup) will give you a starting point to follow the
  tutorial.
- [**Overview**](/docs/tutorial/overview) will teach you the fundamental concepts of Dagster: solids
  and pipelines.
- [**Building Pipelines with Dagster**](/docs/tutorial/execute) will teach you ways to construct and execute a
  simple data pipeline using the basics of Dagster.
- [**Basics of Solids**](/docs/tutorial/basics_solids) will teach you the basics of using solids.
- [**Basics of Pipelines**](/docs/tutorial/basics_solids) will teach you the basics of using
  pipelines.
- [**Making Your Pipelines Testable and Maintainable**](/docs/tutorial/testable) will show you how
  to test your pipelines.
- [**Advanced Tutorials**](/docs/tutorial/advanced) will showcase Dagster's advanced features like
  scheduling and materializations.

### What Are We Building

We'll build examples around a simple but scary CSV dataset, `cereal.csv`, which contains nutritional
facts about 80 breakfast cereals. You can find this dataset on
[Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dagster-io/dagster/master/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv).
Or, if you've cloned the dagster git repository, you'll find this dataset at
`dagster/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv`

To get the flavor of this dataset, let's look at the header and the first five
rows:

```CSV literalinclude caption=cereal.csv
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/cereal.csv
lines:1-6
```

You can find all of the [tutorial code](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial)
checked into the dagster repository.
