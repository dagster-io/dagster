We've already seen how solids can describe their persistent artifacts to the
system using [materializations](#materializations).

Dagster also has a facility for automatically materializing the intermediate
values that actually pass between solids.

This can be very useful for debugging, when you want to inspect the value
output by a solid and ensure that it is as you expect; for audit, when you
want to understand how a particular downstream output was created; and for
re-executing downstream solids with cached results from expensive upstream
computations.

To turn intermediate storage on, just set another key in the pipeline config:

```YAML literalinclude caption=intermediates.yaml emphasize-lines:6-7
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/intermediates.yaml
```

When you execute the pipeline using this config, you'll see new structured
entries in the Dagit log viewer indicating that intermediates have been stored
on the filesystem.

## Intermediate Storage for Custom Data Types

By default, Dagster will try to pickle intermediate values to store them on
the filesystem. Some custom data types cannot be pickled (for instance, a
Spark RDD), so you will need to tell Dagster how to serialize them.

Our toy `LessSimpleDataFrame` is, of course, pickleable, but
supposing it was not, let's set a custom **`SerializationStrategy`** on
it to tell Dagster how to store intermediates of this type.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=16 caption=serialization_strategy.py
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/advanced/intermediates/serialization_strategy.py
lines:16-39
```

Now, when we set the `storage` key in pipeline config and run this
pipeline, we'll see that our intermediate is automatically persisted as a
human-readable .csv:

## Re-execution

Once intermediates are being stored, Dagit makes it possible to individually
execute solids whose outputs are satisfied by previously materialized
intermediates.

Click on the `sort_by_calories.compute` execution step, and you'll
see the option appear to reexecute only this step, using the automatically
materialized intermediate output of the previous solid.

![reexecution_results.png](/assets/images/tutorial/reexecution_results.png)

Reexecuting individual solids can be very helpful while you're writing solids,
or while you're actively debugging them.

You can also manually specify intermediates from previous runs as inputs to
solids. Recall the syntax we used to set input values using the config system:

```YAML literalinclude caption=inputs_env.yaml
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e02_solids/inputs_env.yaml
```

Instead of setting the key `value` (i.e., providing a ), we can
also set `pickle`, as follows:

```YAML literalinclude caption=reexecution_env.yaml
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial//advanced/intermediates/reexecution_env.yaml
```

(Of course, you'll need to use the path to an intermediate that is actually
present on your filesystem.)

If you directly substitute this config into Dagit, you'll see an error,
because the system still expects the input to `sort_by_calories` to
be satisfied by the output from `read_csv`.

![reexecution_errors.png](/assets/images/tutorial/reexecution_errors.png)

To make this config valid, we'll need to tell Dagit to execute only a subset
of the pipeline --just the `sort_by_calories` solid. Click on the
subset-selector button in the top left of the playground, to the left of the
Mode selector (which, when no subset has been specified, will read "\*"):

![subset_selection.png](/assets/images/tutorial/subset_selection.png)

Hit "Apply", and this config will now pass validation, and the individual
solid can be reexecuted:

![subset_config.png](/assets/images/tutorial/subset_config.png)

This facility is especially valuable during test, since it allows you to
validate newly written solids against values generated during previous runs of
a known good pipeline.
