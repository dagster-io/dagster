### Hello, Pipeline!

To execute our solid, we'll embed it in an equally simple pipeline.
A pipeline is a set of solids arranged into a DAG (or href [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)) of
computation. You'll typically define pipelines by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" /> decorator.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=22
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/basics/e01_first_pipeline/hello_cereal.py
caption:hello_cereal.py
lines:22-24
```

Here you'll see that we call `hello_cereal()`. This call doesn't
actually execute the solid -- within the body of functions decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" />, we use
function calls to indicate the dependency structure of the solids making up the pipeline.
Here, we indicate that the execution of
`hello_cereal` doesn't depend on any other solids by calling it
with no arguments.
