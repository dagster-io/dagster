### Composite Solids

The other basic facility that we expect from software in
other domains is composability -- the ability to combine building
blocks into larger functional units.

Composite solids can be used to organize and refactor large or
complicated pipelines, abstracting away complexity, as well as to wrap
reusable general-purpose solids together with domain-specific logic.

As an example, let's compose two instances of a complex,
general-purpose `read_csv` solid along with some domain-specific logic
for the specific purpose of joining our cereal dataset with a lookup
table providing human-readable names for the cereal manufacturers.

```python literalinclude
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/composite_solids.py
caption:composite_solids.py
lines:126-130
```

Defining a composite solid is similar to defining a pipeline, except
that we use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="composite_solid" displayText="@composite_solid" /> decorator
instead of <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" />.

Dagit has sophisticated facilities for visualizing composite solids:

All of the complexity of the composite solid is hidden by default, but
we can expand it at will by clicking into the solid (or on the
"Expand" button in the right-hand pane):

Note the line indicating that the output of `join_cereal` is returned as
the output of the composite solid as a whole.

Config for the individual solids making up the composite is nested, as
follows:

```YAML literalinclude emphasize-lines=1-3
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/composite_solids.yaml
caption:composite_solids.yaml
```

When we execute this pipeline, Dagit includes information about the
nesting of individual execution steps within the composite:
