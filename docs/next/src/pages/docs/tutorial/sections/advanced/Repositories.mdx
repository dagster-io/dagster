import PyObject from 'components/PyObject';

In all of the examples we've seen so far, we've specified a file (`-f`) or a module
(`-m`) and named a pipeline definition function (`-n`) in order to tell the
CLI tools how to load a pipeline, e.g.:

```bash
$ dagit -f hello_cereal.py -n hello_cereal_pipeline $ dagster pipeline
execute -f hello_cereal.py \ -n hello_cereal_pipeline
```

But most of the time, especially when working on long-running projects with
other people, we will want to be able to target many pipelines at once with
our tools.

Dagster provides the concept of a repository, a collection of pipelines that
the Dagster tools can target as a whole. Repositories are declared using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="RepositoryDefinition" /> API
as follows:

```python literalinclude
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/repos.py
caption:repos.py
lineno-start:14
lines:14-24
```

Note that the name of the pipeline in the `RepositoryDefinition`
must match the name we declared for it in its `pipeline` (the
default is the function name). Don't worry, if these names don't match, you'll
see a helpful error message.

If you save this file as `repos.py`, you can then run the command
line tools on it. Try running:

```bash
$ dagit -f repos.py -n define_repo
```

Now you can see the list of all pipelines in the repo via the dropdown at the
top:

![repos.png](/assets/images/tutorial/repos.png)

Typing the name of the file and function defining the repository gets tiresome
and repetitive, so let's create a declarative config file with this
information to make using the command line tools easier. Save this file as
`repository.yaml`. This is the default name for a repository config
file, although you can tell the CLI tools to use any file you like with the
`-y` flag.

```YAML literalinclude
file:/dagster_examples/intro_tutorial/repository.yaml
caption:repository.yaml
```

Now you should be able to list the pipelines in this repo without all the
typing:

```bash
$ dagit
```
