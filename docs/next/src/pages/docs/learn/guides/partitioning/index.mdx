In this guide, well learn about why we partition data and how to write
Dagster pipelines that can easily work with partitioned data. Well
also explore how to schedule partitioned work using Dagsters built-in
scheduler functionalities.

## Partitioning and Scheduling in Dagster

Many data engineering pipelines need to be written so they operate on
partitioned segments of data. These pipelines are also often schedules
so that they execute partitions of data at some interval.

For example, lets say we have a metrics pipeline that partitions data
based on 24 hour time intervals. We will probably want to schedule this
pipeline to run every day at midnight on the previous 24 hours metrics
data. With this setup, well have data continuously processed for every
24 hour segment.

Traditional workflow systems tightly couple partitioning and scheduling
and provide solutions to date partitioned schedules like this metrics
pipeline. However, as weve seen, there are many other ways to
partition data, and these two concepts do not need to be completely
intertwined. Being able to partition data on axis other than time is
especially useful when conducting backfills.

Dagster aims to provides a flexible and generalized solution to
partitioning, backfills, and scheduling that can extend beyond datetime
partitioning, while also providing a set of easy to use tools for the
common datetime partitioning use case.

In the next part of the tutorial, well build a partitioned schedule.

## What is scheduling?

The term "scheduling" is often overloaded in the context of workflow
engines like Dagster. In this case, scheduling pipeline runs
specifically refers to triggering pipeline runs to happen at some
interval. For example, I might want to schedule an email marketing
pipeline once a day at 9AM.

## What is data partitioning?

When working with small datasets, we can easily make queries or run
calculations over the entire dataset at once. Even after updating the
base dataset, its not expensive to redo queries and calculations to
get new answers.

When datasets get extremely large it becomes difficult to work with the
entire dataset in once piece. Queries become slower and inefficient and
even fast data processing tools can take a long time to process
extremely large quantities of data.

When we partition data, we break it up into discrete chunks using some
partitioning scheme. For example, if were working with a large metrics
dataset, we might want to partition the data by country or other
customer segments. Its often easier to reason about data when
segmented into such partitions. Also, with smaller units of the data, we
can process the partitions with less effort and, if there is no
dependence between partitions, we can process the partitions in
parallel.
