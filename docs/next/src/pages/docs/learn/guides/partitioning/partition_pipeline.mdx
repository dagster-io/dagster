# Writing a partition ready pipeline

To get a clearer understanding of how partitioning works in Dagster, we'll work
through an example pipeline that calculates the total volume traded
for a given stock. Volume is defined as the number of shares traded
in a given time period.

We'll use the [Financial Modeling Prep
API](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs) as our data
source. The API has an endpoint that can give us historical price data
for a given stock over a time range:

```bash
https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/historical-price-full/AAPL?from=2019-01-01&to=2019-01-31
```

If we query this URL, we'll recieve a JSON response containing
historical data (partitioned by day) for the stock we queried for - in
this case AAPL. In the historical data, notice how we have volume traded
information.

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "historical": [
    {
      "date": "2019-01-02",
      "open": 154.89,
      "high": 158.85,
      "low": 154.23,
      "close": 157.92,
      "adjClose": 156.05,
      "volume": 3.70397e7,
      "unadjustedVolume": 3.70397e7,
      "change": -3.03,
      "changePercent": -1.956,
      "vwap": 157.0,
      "label": "January 02, 19",
      "changeOverTime": -0.01956
    },
    {
      "date": "2019-01-03",
      "open": 143.98,
      "high": 145.72,
      "low": 142.0,
      "close": 142.19,
      "adjClose": 140.51,
      "volume": 9.13122e7,
      "unadjustedVolume": 9.13122e7,
      "change": 1.79,
      "etc.": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Let's write our first pipeline to query this URL and calculate the
total volume traded during January 2019.

Before we begin, let's set up a project structure to organize our code:

```bash
partition-tutorial
├── repository.py
└── repository.yaml
```

And point our _repository.yaml_ to our repository:

repository.yaml:

```YAML
repository:
    file: repository.py
    fn: define_repo
```

To make a pipeline partitionable, we'll use solid config. This will
allow us to simply change the config to run the pipeline for different
partitions. If you haven't explored the dagster config system, take a
look at the [tutorial](/docs/tutorial/basics_solids#parametrizing-solids-with-config).

Our first solid will take the stock ticker symbol as config, and query
the API to return the volume traded from Jan 01 - Jan 31 2019. We pass
the json response to the downstream solid.

```python literalinclude emphasize-lines=4-16 caption=repository.py
file:/dagster_examples/stocks/pipelines_stock.py
lines:5-20
```

Our second solid will take the json response and total the volume
amounts over all the days:

```python literalinclude caption=repository.py
file:/dagster_examples/stocks/pipelines_stock.py
lines:23-32
```

Great! Now we can wrap this up in a pipeline and repository, then open
the repository in dagit to execute the pipeline.

```{.python}
from dagster import pipeline, repository

@pipeline
def compute_total_stock_volume():
    sum_volume(query_historical_stock_data())

@repository
def partitioning_tutorial():
    return [compute_total_stock_volume]
```

![pipeline.png](/assets/images/learn/guides/partitioning/pipeline.png)

We can configure the pipeline run in the playground to calculate the
total volume for Apple shares:

```{.YAML}
solids:
    query_historical_stock_data:
        config:
            symbol: "AAPL"
```

![config_1.png](/assets/images/learn/guides/partitioning/config_1.png)

Now if we wanted to calculate the total volume for several different
stocks, it's easy to simply change our configuration to run for a
different ticker:

```{.YAML}
solids:
    query_historical_stock_data:
        config:
            symbol: "GOOG"
```
