# Creating a Date Partition Set

The most common partitioning scheme is date based partitions. We'll now
create a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PartitionSetDefinition" /> for a set of dates.

First, let's modify our solid to take a date range as config:

```python literalinclude caption=hello_cereal.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/stocks/repository.py
lines:4-19
```

Just as before, we write a function that returns a list of partitions,
but this time we return a list of `datetime` objects.

```python literalinclude caption=date_partitions.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/stocks/date_partitions.py
lines:9-15
```

Next, we define a function that takes a date <PyObject module="dagster" object="Partition" /> and
returns config. Here, we calculate the first and last days of the
previous month for each date partition to pass to the solid config.

```python literalinclude caption=hello_cereal.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/stocks/date_partitions.py
lines:18-34
```

Since it's not practical to hardcode all the possible date partitions,
and we usually want date partitions between two date ranges, Dagster
provides a utility to generate a list of partitions given a date range
and time interval: <PyObject module="dagster.utils.partitions" object="date_partition_range" />.
We'll use this function instead of the one we wrote above.

```python literalinclude caption=repository.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/stocks/date_partitions.py
lines:37-46
```

Now, let's load dagit again and head to the Playground tab. This time,
we'll see our date partitions in the partition selector.
