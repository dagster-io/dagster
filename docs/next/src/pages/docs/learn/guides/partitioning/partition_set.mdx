# Creating a Simple Partition Set

If we're trying to calculate the total volume of trades for all stocks
in January 2019, it might be difficult to get and process all the data
in one query. Since we already have a pipeline that calculates total
volume for a single stock, and it takes the stock ticker symbol as
config, we can create a partition set to make it easy to run the
pipeline for each partition.

Let's assume there's only four stocks in the world: `AAPL`, `GOOG`,
`MSFT`, `TSLA`

First, we write a function that returns a list of partitions. Here, our
partitions are simply the stock tickers, and we wrap them in <PyObject module="dagster" object="Partition"/> objects.

```python literalinclude emphasize-lines=4-10 caption=repository.py
file:/legacy_examples/dagster_examples/stocks/simple_partitions.py
lines:1-10
```

Next, we define a function that takes a <PyObject module="dagster" object="Partition"/> and
returns config. We pass the <PyObject module="dagster" object="Partition"/> value
to the `query_historical_stock_data` solid config, just like we did in
the previous section.

```python literalinclude caption=repository.py
file:/legacy_examples/dagster_examples/stocks/simple_partitions.py
lines:13-16
```

Finally, we add the partitions to our repository definition:

```python literalinclude emphasize-lines=6
file:/legacy_examples/dagster_examples/stocks/repository.py
caption:repository.py
lines:43-49
```

Now, let's load dagit again and head to the playground. If we click on
the preset button, we now also see our partition set. If we select it,
we can see all the partitions we have and preview the config they
generate.
