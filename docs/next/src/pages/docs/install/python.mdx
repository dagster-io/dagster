# Installing Python and pip

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed
in your environment, you can run:

```console
python --version
pip --version
```

If you're running Python 3.3 or later, you already have the venv
package for managing virtualenvs. On Python 2.7, you can check whether
you have the virtualenv tool installed by running:

```console
virtualenv --version
```

If these tools aren't present on your system, you can install them as
follows:

**Installing Python on Ubuntu**

```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip
```

This will install Python 3 and pip on your system.

**Installing Python on macOS**

Using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```console
brew update
brew install python  # Python 3
```

This will install Python 3 on your system.

If you are using the macOS-provided Python 2.7, you can install
virtualenv with:

```console
sudo pip install -U virtualenv  # system-wide install
```

**Installing Python on Windows**

- Install the _Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3_.
  This comes with _Visual Studio 2015_ but can be installed separately
  as follows:
  1.  Go to the Visual Studio downloads,
  2.  Select _Redistributables and Build Tools_,
  3.  Download and install the _Microsoft Visual C++ 2015
      Redistributable Update 3_.
- Install the 64-bit Python 3 release for Windows (select `pip` as an
  optional feature).

To use the `dagit` tool, you will also need to [install
yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

**Notes on Python virtualenvs**

We strongly recommend installing dagster inside a Python virtualenv.

If you are running Anaconda, you should install dagster inside a Conda
environment.

To create a virtual environment on Python 3, you can just run:

```console
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/dagster
```

This will create a new Python environment whose interpreter and
libraries are isolated from those installed in other virtual
environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a "system"
Python installed as part of your operating system.

On Python 2, you can use a tool like
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to manage your virtual environments, or just run:

```console
virtualenv ~/.venvs/dagster
```

You'll then need to 'activate' the virtualenvironment, in bash by
running:

```console
source ~/.venvs/dagster/bin/activate
```

(For other shells, see the [venv
documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments).)

If you are using Anaconda, you can run:

```console
conda create --name dagster
```

And then, on macOS or Ubuntu:

```console
source activate dagster
```

Or, on Windows:

```console
activate dagster
```
