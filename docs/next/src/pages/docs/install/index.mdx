# Quick start

To install dagster and dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core dagster packages
in your current Python environment.

Dagster is tested on Python 3.8, 3.7, 3.6, 3.5, and 2.7.

Note that some libraries may not work on Python 3.8 yet, as PySpark does
[not yet have support for Python 3.8](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/26194).

Using Python 3 is strongly encouraged, as the [official
EOL](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) for Python 2 was
January 1, 2020.

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed
in your environment, you can run:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

We strongly recommend installing dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If
you are running Anaconda, you should install dagster inside a Conda
environment.

If you would like to install dagster from source, please see the section
on [Contributing](/docs/community/contributing).
