# Community

No ecosystem is more heterogeneous than data processing. We
enthusiastically welcome community contributions to code and to docs,
issue and bug reports on
[Github](https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster/), and questions,
feature requests, and discussion in our
[Slack](https://dagster-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

If you're interested in hacking on Dagster, you'll want to consult our
instructions on [setting up a local development
environment](/community/contributing).

We are committed to making the Dagster project inclusive and welcoming.
Working on this project should feel friendly, collegial, and relaxed for
everyone. We take our [code of conduct](/community/code_of_conduct) seriously
and encourage you to review it.
