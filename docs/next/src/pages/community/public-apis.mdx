# Adding or Changing Public APIs

We don’t want to thrash users, so we want to be careful about changing and adding public APIs.

## What counts as a public API

- Anything that’s importable via `from dagster import`
- Anything that’s importable via `from dagster-<subpackage> import`
- The Dagster command-line interface.


## What to do before changing, deprecating, or adding a public API

- Make an issue in Github describing the change.  Some things that are helpful to include:
    - Usage examples, compared with previous state.
    - A rationale for the change.
    - A rollout timeline, including deprecation, if applicable.
- Post a link to the issue in the #proposed-api-changes channel.
- If adding an API, consider marking it “experimental”, which means it can change in point releases without warning.
- If not experimental, get sign-off from Nick.


## What to do after changing a public API

- Update CHANGES.md
    - Make sure to include the rationale for the change.
