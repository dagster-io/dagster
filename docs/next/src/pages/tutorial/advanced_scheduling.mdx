# Advanced: Scheduling Pipeline Runs

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/" />

Dagster includes a simple built-in scheduler that works with Dagit, which is useful when you need to
schedule pipelines to run at regular intervals, e.g. daily or hourly.

Suppose that we need to run our simple cereal pipeline every morning before breakfast, at 6:45 AM.

## Requirements

You'll need to install the `dagster-cron` library.

```bash
pip install dagster-cron
```

You must also ensure that `cron` is installed on the machine you're running the scheduler on.

## Pipeline

```python literalinclude showLines caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_0
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_0
```

As before, we've defined a solid and a pipeline.

## Defining the Scheduler on the Instance

We first need to define the `Scheduler` on our <PyObject module="dagster.core.instance"
object="DagsterInstance" />. For now, the only implemented scheduler is <PyObject
module="dagster_cron" object="SystemCronScheduler"/>, but this is pluggable (and you can write your
own). To use the scheduler, add the following lines to your `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml`:

```yaml
scheduler:
  module: dagster_cron.cron_scheduler
  class: SystemCronScheduler
```

## Defining schedules

Now we'll write a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to define the schedule
we want. We can either directly construct a `ScheduleDefinition`, or use one of the included schedule
decorators.

In this example, we'll use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="daily_schedule" displayText="@daily_schedule" />
decorator, which runs a schedule once a day at a specified time.

The decorated function should return the `run_config` needed to run the schedule at execution time.
The function is passed the date for which the schedule is running.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=27 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
startAfter:start_scheduler_marker_1
endBefore:end_scheduler_marker_1
```

To complete the picture, we'll need to add the schedule definition to the list of definitions returned
from our repository.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=42 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
lines:42-44
```

## Starting schedules

Whenever we make changes to schedule definitions, we need to run `dagster schedule up`. This utility
will create, update, or remove schedules in the underlying system cron file as appropriate to assure
it is consistent with the schedule definitions in code.

To preview the changes, first run:

```bash
dagster schedule up --preview
Planned Changes:
  + good_morning_schedule (add)
```

After confirming schedule changes are as expected, run:

```bash
dagster schedule up
Changes:
  + good_morning_schedule (add)
```

To start running the schedule, run:

```bash
dagster schedule start good_morning_schedule
```

Verify that the `good_morning_schedule` scheduled job has been added to `cron`:

```bash
crontab -l
```

Now, we can load Dagit to view the schedule and monitor runs:

```bash
dagit
```

### Cron filters

If you need to define a more specific schedule than cron allows, you can pass a function in the
`should_execute` argument to <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" />.

For example, we can define a filter that only returns _`True`_ on weekdays:

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=47 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
lines:47-50
```

If we combine this `should_execute` filter with a
schedule that runs at 6:45am every day, then we'll
have a schedule that runs at 6:45am only on weekdays.

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=53 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
lines:53-58
```
