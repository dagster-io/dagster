# Advanced: Scheduling Pipeline Runs

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/" />

Dagster includes a simple built-in scheduler that works with Dagit, which is useful when you need to
schedule pipelines to run at regular intervals, e.g. daily or hourly.

Suppose that we need to run our simple cereal pipeline every morning before breakfast, at 6:45 AM.

## Requirements

You'll need to install the `dagster-cron` library.

```bash
pip install dagster-cron
```

You must also ensure that `cron` is installed on the machine you're running the scheduler on.

## Pipeline

```python literalinclude showLines caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
lines:1-34
```

As before, we've defined some solids, a pipeline, and a repository.

## Defining the scheduler

We first need to define the Scheduler on our <PyObject module="dagster.core.instance"
object="DagsterInstance" />. For now, the only implemented scheduler is <PyObject
module="dagster_cron" object="SystemCronScheduler"/>, but this is pluggable (and you can write your
own). To use the scheduler, add the following lines to your `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml`:

```yaml
scheduler:
  module: dagster_cron.cron_scheduler
  class: SystemCronScheduler
```

## Defining schedules

Now we'll write a <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" /> to define the schedule
we want. We pass the `cron_schedule` parameter to this class to define when the pipeline should run
using the standard cron syntax; the other parameters determine other familiar aspects of how the
pipeline will run, such as its config.

We wrap the schedule definition in a function decorated with <PyObject module="dagster"
object="schedules" displayText="@schedules" />

```python literalinclude showLines startLine=36 caption=scheduler.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.py
lines:36-45
```

To complete the picture, we'll need to extend the `repository.yaml` structure we've met before with
a new key, `scheduler`.

```YAML literalinclude caption=scheduler.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/scheduling/scheduler.yaml
```

## Starting schedules

Whenever we make changes to schedule definitions, we need to run `dagster schedule up`. This utility
will create, update, or remove schedules in the underlying system cron file as appropriate to assure
it is consistent with the schedule definitions in code.

To preview the changes, first run:

```bash
dagster schedule up --preview -y scheduler.yaml
Planned Changes:
  + good_morning (add)
```

After confirming schedule changes are as expected, run:

```bash
dagster schedule up -y scheduler.yaml
Changes:
  + good_morning (add)
```

Verify that the `good_morning` scheduled job has been added to `cron`:

```bash
crontab -l
```

If the `good_morning` job is not listed, you may have to start it with:

```bash
dagster schedule start good_morning
```

Now, we can load dagit to view the schedule and monitor runs:

```bash
dagit -y scheduler.yaml
```

### Cron filters

If you need to define a more specific schedule than cron allows, you can pass a function in the
`should_execute` argument to <PyObject module="dagster" object="ScheduleDefinition" />.

For example, we can define a filter that only returns _`True`_ on weekdays:

```python
import datetime

def weekday_filter():
    weekno = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()
    # Returns true if current day is a weekday
    return weekno < 5
```

If we combine this _should_execute_ filter with a
_cron_schedule_ that runs at 6:45am every day, then we'll
have a schedule that runs at 6:45am only on weekdays.

```python
good_weekday_morning = ScheduleDefinition(
    name="good_weekday_morning",
    cron_schedule="45 6 * * *",
    pipeline_name="hello_cereal_pipeline",
    run_config={"storage": {"filesystem": {}}},
    should_execute=weekday_filter,
)
```
