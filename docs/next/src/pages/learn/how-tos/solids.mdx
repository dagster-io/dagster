# Solids

## What is a solid?

A solid is a functional unit of computation. It has defined inputs and
outputs, and multiple solids can be wired together to form a <PyObject module="dagster" object="PipelineDefinition" displayText="Pipeline" /> by
defining dependencies between solid inputs and outputs.

There are two ways to define a solid:

1.  Wrap a python function in the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator
    _\[Preferred\]_
2.  Construct a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition"/> object

_Method 1: Using the decorator_

To use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator,
wrap a function that takes a `context` argument as the first
parameter. The context is provides access to system information such as
resources and solid configuration. See [What is a solid
context](#what-is-solid-context) for more information.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lineno-start:
lines:6-8
```

_Method 2: Constructing the SolidDefinition object_

To construct a <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition"/> object,
you need to pass the constructor a solid name,
input definitions, output definitions, and a `compute_fn`. The compute
function is the same as the function you would decorate using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:11-17
```

## What is solid context?

A context object is passed as the first parameter to a solid's
`compute_fn`. The context is an instance of <PyObject module="dagster" object="SystemComputeExecutionContext" />,
and provides access to:

- solid configuration (`context.solid_config`)
- loggers (`context.log`)
- resources (`context.resources`)
- run ID (`context.run_id`)

For example, to access the logger

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:20-22
```

## How do I define inputs and outputs for a solid?

Dependencies between solids in Dagster are defined using <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitions" /> and <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" displayText="OutputDefinitions" />.
Input and Output definitions are:

- Named
- Optionally typed
- Optionally have human readable descriptions

_Inputs:_

Inputs are arguments to a solid's `compute_fn`, and are specified using <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitionss" />.
They can be passed from outputs of other solids, or stubbed using config.

A solid only executes once all of its inputs have been resolved, which
means that the all of the outputs that the solid depends on have been
successfully yielded.

The argument names of the `compute_fn` must match the <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitionss" /> names,
and must be in the same order after the context argument.

For example, if we wanted a solid with two inputs of type `int`:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:25-27
```

_Outputs:_

Outputs are yielded from a solid's `compute_fn`. A solid can yield
multiple outputs.

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:30-36
```

## Using typehints to automatically infer `InputDefinitions` and `OutputDefinitions`

If you are using python typehints, Dagster can automatically infer <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputDefinition" displayText="InputDefinitions" /> and <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" displayText="OutputDefinitions" />.

The restriction is that you can only use return type hints when
returning one output. This is because Dagster solids `yield` one or more <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" displayText="Outputs" />,
among other events, and returning a single value is equivalent to yielding one output.

If you need to return _multiple_ outputs from a solid, you still need to
explicitly define <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputDefinition" displayText="OutputDefinitions" />.

For example, the following are equivalent:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:39-49
```

## What does a solid return?

A solid can yield a stream of events within its `compute_fn` to
communicate with the Dagster framework. These events must be one of the
following types:

- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExpectationResult" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="TypeCheck" />
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="Failure" /> (meant to be raised)

To return an output from a solid, simply `yield` an <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" /> event:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:52-54
```

Many solids yield only one output, like the example above. Returning a
single value from a solid's `compute_fn` is equivalent to yielding a
single <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" /> event
with the default output name "result". For example:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:57-65
```

Note that you cannot `yield` a single value without wrapping it <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" />.
This is because a solid can yield arbitrarily many values, and there's no way
for the system to tell which one the author of the solid meant to use as
its output. For example:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:68-71
```

If you want to have multiple outputs for a solid, you cannot return
anything from the solid. Instead, you need to `yield` multiple <PyObject module="dagster" object="Output" /> events,
each of which is named and defined on `output_defs` to prevent ambiguity:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:74-77
```

## Programmatically generating solids (Solid factories):

You may find the need to create utilities that help generate solids.

Generally, you want to parameterize solid behavior by adding solid
configuration. You should reach for this pattern if you find yourself
needing to vary the <PyObject module="dagster" object="SolidDefinition" /> or <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator
arguments themselves, since they cannot be modified based on solid configuration.

General solid factory pattern:

```python literalinclude caption=solids.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/how_tos/solids.py
lines:80-98
```
