# GraphQL API

Dagster exposes a GraphQL API that allows clients to programmatically interact with Dagster. The API allows users to:

- Query information about pipeline runs (both historical and currently executing)
- Retrieve metadata about repositories, pipelines, and solids (such as pipeline structure and config schemas)
- Launch pipeline executions and re-executions, allowing users to trigger pipeline executions on custom events

## Note about breaking changes

The GraphQL API is still evolving and is subject to breaking changes. A large portion of the API is
primarily for internal use by Dagit. For any of the queries below, we will be clear about breaking changes
in release notes.

## Using the GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is served alongside the Dagit web server. To start the server, simply run `dagit` in
your Dagster workspace.

```
dagit
```

Now the GraphQL API will be served at the `/graphql` endpoint. If you are running Dagit locally on
port 3000, you can access the API at `localhost:3000/graphql`

### Using the GraphQL Playground

You can access the GraphQL Playground by navigating to the `/graphql` route in your browser. The
GraphQL Playground contains the full GraphQL Schema and an interactive playground to write and test
queries and mutations.

### Exploring the GraphQL Schema and Documentation

Clicking on the `Docs` tab on the right edge of the playground will open up interactive documentation
for the GraphQL API. This is the best way to explore the API and get information about which fields are available
on the queries and mutations.

## Example Queries

### Get a list of pipelines runs

To retrieve a list of all pipeline runs, use the `pipelineRunsOrError` query.

```gql
query PaginatedPipelineRuns {
  pipelineRunsOrError {
    __typename
    ... on PipelineRuns {
      results {
        runId
        pipelineName
        status
        runConfigYaml
        stats {
          ... on PipelineRunStatsSnapshot {
            startTime
            endTime
            stepsFailed
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pagination

You may eventually accumulate too many runs to return in one query. The `pipelineRunsOrError` query
takes in optional `cursor` and `limit` arguments for pagination:

```gql
query PaginatedPipelineRuns {
  pipelineRunsOrError(
    cursor: "7fd2e5ef-5591-43db-be15-1ebbbbed8bb5"
    limit: 10
  ) {
    __typename
    ... on PipelineRuns {
      results {
        runId
        pipelineName
        status
        runConfigYaml
        stats {
          ... on PipelineRunStatsSnapshot {
            startTime
            endTime
            stepsFailed
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Filters

The `pipelineRunsOrError` query also takes in an optional filter argument, of type `PipelineRunsFilter`.
This allows you to filter runs by:

- run ID
- pipeline name
- tags
- status

For example, the following query will return all failed runs:

```gql
query FilteredPipelineRuns {
  pipelineRunsOrError(filter: { status: FAILURE }) {
    __typename
    ... on PipelineRuns {
      results {
        runId
        pipelineName
        status
        runConfigYaml
        stats {
          ... on PipelineRunStatsSnapshot {
            startTime
            endTime
            stepsFailed
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get a list of repositories

This query will retrieve the names and location names of all the repositories currently loaded.

```gql caption=repositoriesQuery.gql
query RepositoriesQuery {
  repositoriesOrError {
    ... on RepositoryConnection {
      nodes {
        name
        location {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get a list of pipelines within a repository:

Given a repository, this query will retrieve the names of all the pipelines in the repository.

This query takes a `selector`, which is of type `RepositorySelector`. This consists of both the
repository location name and repository name.

```gql caption=pipelinesQuery.gql
query PipelinesQuery(
  $repositoryLocationName: String!
  $repositoryName: String!
) {
  repositoryOrError(
    repositorySelector: {
      repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
      repositoryName: $repositoryName
    }
  ) {
    ... on Repository {
      pipelines {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Launch a pipeline run

To execute a pipeline, we can use the `launchPipelineExecution` mutation. Here, we define
`ExecutePipeline` to wrap our mutation and allow us pass in the required arguments as query
variables.

For this query, the required arguments are:

`selector`:

- This is of type `PipelineSelector`, and consists of the repository location name, repository name, and pipeline name
- You can also add a `solidSelection` argument here, to execute a subset of the pipeline

`runConfigData`:

- This is where you define the run config to execute the pipeline with
- Note that `runConfigData` is of type `RunConfigData`. This type is used when passing in an
  arbitrary object for run config. This is any-typed in the GraphQL type system
  but must conform to the constraints of the config schema for this pipeline. If it does not, the
  mutation will appropriately return a `PipelineConfigValidationInvalid` response

`mode`:

- The mode to run the pipeline with.
- If you have not defined any custom modes for your pipeline, the default mode is `default`

```
mutation ExecutePipeline(
  $repositoryLocationName: String!
  $repositoryName: String!
  $pipelineName: String!
  $runConfigData: RunConfigData!
  $mode: String!
) {
  launchPipelineExecution(
    executionParams: {
      selector: {
        repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
        repositoryName: $repositoryName
        pipelineName: $pipelineName
      }
      runConfigData: $runConfigData
      mode: $mode
    }
  ) {
    __typename
    ... on LaunchPipelineRunSuccess {
      run {
        runId
      }
    }
    ... on PipelineConfigValidationInvalid {
      errors {
        message
        reason
      }
    }
    ... on PythonError {
      message
    }
  }
}
```

### Launch a pipeline run with preset

If you want to use a preset instead of defining the run config, use the `preset` argument instead.:

```
mutation ExecutePipeline(
  $repositoryLocationName: String!
  $repositoryName: String!
  $pipelineName: String!
  $presetName: String!
) {
  launchPipelineExecution(
    executionParams: {
      selector: {
        repositoryLocationName: $repositoryLocationName
        repositoryName: $repositoryName
        pipelineName: $pipelineName
      }
      preset: $presetName
    }
  ) {
    __typename
    ... on LaunchPipelineRunSuccess {
      run {
        runId
      }
    }
  }
}
```
