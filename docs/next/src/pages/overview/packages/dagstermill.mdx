# Data Science with Notebooks

- [Notebooks as solids](#notebooks-as-solids)
- [Expressing dependencies](#expressing-dependencies)
- [The notebook context](#the-notebook-context)
- [Results and custom materializations](#results-and-custom-materializations)

Fast iteration, the literate combination of arbitrary code with markdown
blocks, and inline plotting make notebooks an indispensible tool for
data science. The Dagstermill package makes it straightforward to run
notebooks using the Dagster tools and to integrate them into data
pipelines with heterogeneous solids: for instance, Spark jobs, SQL
statements run against a data warehouse, or arbitrary Python code.

```bash
pip install dagstermill
```

Dagstermill lets you:

- Run notebooks as solids in heterogeneous data pipelines with minimal
  changes to notebook code
- Define data dependencies to flow inputs and outputs between
  notebooks, and between notebooks and other solids
- Use Dagster resources, and the Dagster config system, from inside
  notebooks
- Aggregate notebook logs with logs from other Dagster solids
- Yield custom materializations and other Dagster events from your
  notebook code

Our goal is to make it unnecessary to go through a tedious
"productionization" process where code developed in notebooks must be
translated into some other (less readable and interpretable) format in
order to be integrated into production workflows. Instead, we can use
notebooks as solids directly, with minimal, incremental metadata
declarations to integrate them into pipelines that may also contain
arbitrary heterogeneous solids.

## Notebooks as solids

Let's consider the classic Iris dataset (1, 2), collected in 1936
by the American botanist Edgar Anderson and made famous by statistician
Ronald Fisher. The Iris dataset is a basic example in machine learning
because it contains three classes of observation, one of which is
straightforwardly linearly separable from the other two, which in turn
can only be distinguished by more sophisticated methods.

> - [K-means clustering for the Iris data set](/assets/source/learn/guides/data_science/iris-kmeans.ipynb).

Like many notebooks, this example does some fairly sophisticated work,
producing diagnostic plots and a (flawed) statistical model -- which
are then locked away in the .ipynb format, can only be reproduced using
a complex Jupyter setup, and are only programmatically accessible within
the notebook context.

We can simply turn a notebook into a solid using <PyObject module="dagstermill" object="define_dagstermill_solid" />.
Once we create a solid, we can start to make its outputs more accessible.

```python literalinclude showLines emphasize-lines=6-8 caption=iris_pipeline.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/data_science/iris_pipeline.py
```

This is the simplest form of notebook integration -- we don't actually
have to make any changes in the notebook itself to run it using the
Dagster tooling. Just run:

```bash
dagit -f iris_pipeline.py
```

What's more, every time we run the notebook from Dagit, a copy of the
notebook _as executed_ will be written to disk and the path
of this output notebook will be made available in Dagit:

![iris_output_notebook.png](/assets/images/learn/guides/data_science/iris_output_notebook.png)

The output notebook is both a rich log of notebook computations as they
actually occurred, including all inline plots and results, and also an
important tool for interactive debugging. When a notebook fails, the
output notebook can be used to determine the cause of the failure.

## Expressing dependencies

Notebooks often have implicit dependencies on external state like data
warehouses, filesystems, and batch processes. For example, even in our
simple Iris example we're making assumptions about data that's
available locally, in this case the `iris.data` file:

```python
[2]:
ipython3

iris = pd.read_csv(
    'iris.data',
    ...
)
```

The ability to express data dependencies between heterogeneous units of
computation is core to Dagster, and we can easily make notebooks depend
on upstream solids.

We'll illustrate this process by adding a non-notebook solid to our
pipeline, which will take care of downloading the Iris data from the UCI
repository. This is a somewhat contrived example; in practice, your
notebook solids are more likely to rely on upstream jobs whose outputs
might be handles to tables in the data warehouse or to files on S3, and
your notebook will likely handle the task of fetching the data.

```python literalinclude showLines emphasize-lines=2,10,16 caption=iris_pipeline_2.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/data_science/iris_pipeline_2.py
```

We'll configure the `download_file` solid with the URL to download the
file from, and the local path at which to save it. This solid has one
output&mdash;the path to the downloaded file.

```python literalinclude showLines emphasize-lines=10-11,14-16,27 caption=download_file.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/data_science/download_file.py
```

We'll want to use this path in
place of the hardcoded string when we read the csv in to our notebook:

```python
[2]:
ipython3

iris = pd.read_csv(
    path,
    ...
)
```

We need to make one more change to our notebook so that the `path`
parameter is injected by the Dagstermill machinery at runtime.

Dagstermill is built on Papermill ([3](#3)), which uses Jupyter cell tags to identify the cell into
which it should inject parameters at runtime. You will need to be
running Jupyter 5.0 or later and may need to turn the display of cell
tags on (select _View \> Cell Toolbar \> Tags_ from the Jupyter menu).

<p align="center">
  <img atl="tags.png" src="/assets/images/learn/guides/data_science/tags.png" />
</p>

Tag the cell you want Dagstermill to replace at runtime with the tag
`parameters`.

In the [source notebook](/assets/source/learn/guides/data_science/iris-kmeans_2.ipynb)., this cell will look like
this:

![parameters.png](/assets/images/learn/guides/data_science/parameters.png)

In the source notebook, we can give our parameters values that are
useful for interactive development (say, with a test dataset).

Now we are ready to execute a pipeline that flows the output of
arbitrary Python code into a notebook:

![iris_pipeline.png](/assets/images/learn/guides/data_science/iris_pipeline.png)

We'll use the following config:

```python literalinclude caption=iris_pipeline.yaml
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/data_science/iris_pipeline.yaml
```

When we execute this pipeline with Dagit, the `parameters` cell in the
source notebook will be dynamically replaced in the output notebook by a
new `injected-parameters` cell.

The execution log contains the path to the output notebook so that you
can access it after execution to examine and potentially debug the
output. This path is also displayed in Dagit.

## The notebook context

You'll notice that the `injected-parameters` cell in your output
notebooks defines a variable called `context`.

This context object mirrors the execution context object that's
available in the body of any other solid's compute function.

As with the parameters that dagstermill injects, you can also construct
a context object for interactive exploration and development by using
the `dagstermill.get_context` API in the tagged `parameters` cell of
your input notebook. When dagstermill executes your notebook, this
development context will be replaced with the injected runtime context.

You can use the development context to access solid config and
resources, to log messages, and to yield results and other Dagster
events just as you would in production. When the runtime context is
injected by dagstermill, none of your other code needs to change.

For instance, suppose we want to make the number of clusters (the \_k\_ in k-means)
configurable. We'll change our solid definition to include a config field:

```python literalinclude showLines emphasize-lines=10-12 caption=iris_pipeline_3.py
file:/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/legacy/data_science/iris_pipeline_3.py
```

In our notebook, we'll stub the context as follows (in the `parameters` cell):

<!-- do not hardcode code snippets https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues/2706 -->

```python
import dagstermill
from dagster import Field, Int, SolidDefinition

context = dagstermill.get_context(solid_config=3)
```

Now we can use our config value in our estimator. In production, this
will be replaced by the config value provided to the pipeline:

```python
estimator = sklearn.cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=context.solid_config)
```

## Results and custom materializations

If you'd like to yield a result to be consumed downstream of a
dagstermill notebook, you can call `dagstermill.yield_result` with the
value of the result and its name. In interactive execution, this is a
no-op, so you don't need to change anything when moving from
interactive exploration and development to production.

You can also yield custom <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> objects
(for instance, to tell Dagit where you've saved a plot) by calling `dagstermill.yield_event`.
