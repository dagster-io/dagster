# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# We add two kinds of packages to `sys.path`:
#
# - Targets for `autodoc` (referenced via e.g. `automodule` in our doc source rst files).
#   `autodoc` runs in python and actually imports its targets, so they must be available on
#   `sys.path`.
# - Custom sphinx extensions (autodoc_dagster).

# Without this, no methods will be rendered unless `:members:` is explicitly set on an individual
# directive invocation. Note that filtration by publicity (done in the `autodoc_dagster` extension)
# is performed on the member list controlled by this option-- without `members` set, even a method
# marked `@public` will _not_ be included in the docs!

# List of all packages that should be mocked when autodoc is running. Autodoc is going to import
# dagster packages, which in turn import various third-party packages. The vast majority of those
# packages are not actually needed to build the docs, but autodoc will nonetheless choke if it can't
# resolve their imports. By mocking them, we let autodoc do its work while keeping the build
# environment simple. If a build fails due to a failed import, try adding the root package for that
# import (e.g. `foo` for `foo.bar`) here. See `docs/README.md` for more details.
