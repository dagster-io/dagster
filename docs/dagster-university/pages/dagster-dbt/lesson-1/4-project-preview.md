# Project preview

In this course, we’ll focus on integrating a dbt project with Dagster from end to end. We’ll build on the Dagster project used in the Dagster Essentials course, which uses data from [NYC OpenData](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). If you haven’t completed Dagster Essentials, no worries - we'll show you what to do in the next lesson.

By the end of the course, you will:

- Create dbt models and load them into Dagster as assets
- Run dbt and store the transformed data in a DuckDB database
- Apply partitions to incremental dbt models
- Deploy the Dagster project to Dagster+
