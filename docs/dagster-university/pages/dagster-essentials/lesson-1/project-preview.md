# Project preview

In this course, we will focus on asset-aware orchestrators and how they make data pipelines easier to manage. You’ll use Dagster, an open-source orchestrator, to build a sample data pipeline.

Using data from [NYC OpenData,](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) you’ll build a data pipeline that:

- Extracts the data, stored in Parquet files, from NYC OpenData
- Loads it into a DuckDB database
- Transforms and prepares it for analysis
- Creates a visualization using the transformed data

If you get stuck or want to jump ahead, check out the [finished project here on GitHub](https://github.com/dagster-io/project-dagster-university).
