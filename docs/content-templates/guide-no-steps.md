## Title that describes this section

For section headings:

- Guides can (and should) contain multiple sections, with each one being a small chunk of information. Break large topics into smaller topics, using subsequent headings (H3, H4, etc) as needed
- Titles should describe an action, ex: "Generate a token"
- Don't use gerunds (-ing) in titles, as it can cause issues with translation + SEO
