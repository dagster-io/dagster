This section is an intro that includes:

- A brief description of what the topic is,
- An example of how it could be used in the real-world
- What it can do in the UI

## Benefits

This section lists the benefits of using the topic, whatever it is. The items listed here should be solutions to real-world problems that the user cares about, ex:

Using schedules helps you:

- Predictably process and deliver data to stakeholders and business-critical applications
- Consistently run data pipelines without the need for manual intervention
- Optimize resource usage by scheduling pipelines to run during off-peak hours

Using [TOPIC] helps you:

- A benefit of the thing
- Another benefit
- And one more

## Prerequisites

This section lists the prerequisites users must complete before they should/can proceed. For concepts, we should list the other concepts they should be familiar with first.

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- Ex: To use asset checks, users should understand Asset definitions first
- Another one
- One more

## How it works

This section provides a high-level overview of how the concept works without getting too into the technical details. Code can be shown here, but this section shouldn't focus on it. The goal is to help the user generally understand how the thing works and what they need to do to get it working without overwhelming them with details.

For example, this is the How it works for Schedules:

Schedules run jobs at fixed time intervals and have two main components:

- A job, which targets a selection of assets or ops

- A cron expression, which defines when the schedule runs. Basic and complex schedules are supported, allowing you to have fine-grained control over when runs are executed. With cron syntax, you can:

  - Create custom schedules like Every hour from 9:00AM - 5:00PM with cron expressions (0 9-17 \* \* \*)
  - Quickly create basic schedules like Every day at midnight with predefined cron definitions (@daily, @midnight)

  To make creating cron expressions easier, you can use an online tool like Crontab Guru. This tool allows you to create and describe cron expressions in a human-readable format and test the execution dates produced by the expression. Note: While this tool is useful for general cron expression testing, always remember to test your schedules in Dagster to ensure the results are as expected.

For a schedule to run, it must be turned on and an active dagster-daemon process must be running. If you used `dagster dev` to start the Dagster UI/webserver, the daemon process will be automatically launched alongside the webserver.

After these criteria are met, the schedule will run at the interval specified in the cron expression. Schedules will execute in UTC by default, but you can specify a custom timezone.

## Getting started

This section is a list of guides / links to pages to help the user get started using the topic.

Check out these guides to get started with [CONCEPT]:

From here, you can:

- Construct schedules to run partitioned jobs
- Execute jobs in specific timezones
- Learn to test your schedules
- Identify and resolve common issues with our troubleshooting guide

### Limitations [and notes]

This section should describe any known limitations that could impact the user, ex: "Schedules will execute in UTC unless a timezone is specified"
