No ecosystem is more heterogeneous than data processing. We enthusiastically welcome
community contributions to code and to docs, issue and bug reports on
`Github <https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster/>`_, and questions, feature
requests, and discussion in our
`Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/dagster/shared_invite/enQtNjEyNjkzNTA2OTkzLTI0MzdlNjU0ODVhZjQyOTMyMGM1ZDUwZDQ1YjJmYjI3YzExZGViMDI1ZDlkNTY5OThmYWVlOWM1MWVjN2I3NjU>`_.

If you're interested in hacking on Dagster, you'll want to consult our instructions
on `setting up a local development environment <contributing.html>`_.

We are committed to making the Dagster project inclusive and welcoming. Working on this project
should feel friendly, collegial, and relaxed for everyone. We take our
`code of conduct <code_of_conduct.html>`_ seriously and encourage you to review it.
