    Celery-based executor which launches tasks in docker containers.

    The Celery executor exposes config settings for the underlying Celery app under
    the `config_source` key. This config corresponds to the “new lowercase settings” introduced
    in Celery version 4.0 and the object constructed from config will be passed to the
    `celery.Celery` constructor as its `config_source` argument.
    (See [https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html) for details.)

    The executor also exposes the `broker`, <cite>backend</cite>, and `include` arguments to the
    `celery.Celery` constructor.

    In the most common case, you may want to modify the `broker` and `backend` (e.g., to use
    Redis instead of RabbitMQ). We expect that `config_source` will be less frequently
    modified, but that when op executions are especially fast or slow, or when there are
    different requirements around idempotence or retry, it may make sense to execute jobs
    with variations on these settings.

    To use the <cite>celery_docker_executor</cite>, set it as the <cite>executor_def</cite> when defining a job:

        ```python
        from dagster import job
        from dagster_celery_docker.executor import celery_docker_executor

        @job(executor_def=celery_docker_executor)
        def celery_enabled_job():
            pass
        ```
    Then you can configure the executor as follows:

        ```YAML
        execution:
          config:
            docker:
              image: 'my_repo.com/image_name:latest'
              registry:
                url: 'my_repo.com'
                username: 'my_user'
                password: {env: 'DOCKER_PASSWORD'}
              env_vars: ["DAGSTER_HOME"] # environment vars to pass from celery worker to docker
              container_kwargs: # keyword args to be passed to the container. example:
                volumes: ['/home/user1/:/mnt/vol2','/var/www:/mnt/vol1']

            broker: 'pyamqp://guest@localhost//'  # Optional[str]: The URL of the Celery broker
            backend: 'rpc://' # Optional[str]: The URL of the Celery results backend
            include: ['my_module'] # Optional[List[str]]: Modules every worker should import
            config_source: # Dict[str, Any]: Any additional parameters to pass to the
                #...       # Celery workers. This dict will be passed as the `config_source`
                #...       # argument of celery.Celery().
        ```
    Note that the YAML you provide here must align with the configuration with which the Celery
    workers on which you hope to run were started. If, for example, you point the executor at a
    different broker than the one your workers are listening to, the workers will never be able to
    pick up tasks for execution.

    In deployments where the celery_docker_job_executor is used all appropriate celery and dagster_celery
    commands must be invoked with the <cite>-A dagster_celery_docker.app</cite> argument.
