    In contrast to the `K8sRunLauncher`, which launches dagster runs as single K8s
    Jobs, this run launcher is intended for use in concert with
    [`dagster_celery_k8s.celery_k8s_job_executor()`](#dagster_celery_k8s.celery_k8s_job_executor).

    With this run launcher, execution is delegated to:

    > 

    1. A run worker Kubernetes Job, which traverses the dagster run execution plan and
       submits steps to Celery queues for execution;
    2. The step executions which are submitted to Celery queues are picked up by Celery workers,
       and each step execution spawns a step execution Kubernetes Job. See the implementation
       defined in `dagster_celery_k8.executor.create_k8s_job_task()`.


You can configure a Dagster instance to use this RunLauncher by adding a section to your
`dagster.yaml` like the following:

    ```yaml
    run_launcher:
      module: dagster_k8s.launcher
      class: CeleryK8sRunLauncher
      config:
        instance_config_map: "dagster-k8s-instance-config-map"
        dagster_home: "/some/path"
        postgres_password_secret: "dagster-k8s-pg-password"
        broker: "some_celery_broker_url"
        backend: "some_celery_backend_url"
    ```

    Celery-based executor which launches tasks as Kubernetes Jobs.

    The Celery executor exposes config settings for the underlying Celery app under
    the `config_source` key. This config corresponds to the “new lowercase settings” introduced
    in Celery version 4.0 and the object constructed from config will be passed to the
    `celery.Celery` constructor as its `config_source` argument.
    (See [https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html) for details.)

    The executor also exposes the `broker`, <cite>backend</cite>, and `include` arguments to the
    `celery.Celery` constructor.

    In the most common case, you may want to modify the `broker` and `backend` (e.g., to use
    Redis instead of RabbitMQ). We expect that `config_source` will be less frequently
    modified, but that when op executions are especially fast or slow, or when there are
    different requirements around idempotence or retry, it may make sense to execute dagster jobs
    with variations on these settings.

    To use the <cite>celery_k8s_job_executor</cite>, set it as the <cite>executor_def</cite> when defining a job:

        ```python
        from dagster import job
        from dagster_celery_k8s.executor import celery_k8s_job_executor


        @job(executor_def=celery_k8s_job_executor)
        def celery_enabled_job():
            pass
        ```
    Then you can configure the executor as follows:

        ```YAML
        execution:
          config:
            job_image: 'my_repo.com/image_name:latest'
            job_namespace: 'some-namespace'
            broker: 'pyamqp://guest@localhost//'  # Optional[str]: The URL of the Celery broker
            backend: 'rpc://' # Optional[str]: The URL of the Celery results backend
            include: ['my_module'] # Optional[List[str]]: Modules every worker should import
            config_source: # Dict[str, Any]: Any additional parameters to pass to the
                #...       # Celery workers. This dict will be passed as the `config_source`
                #...       # argument of celery.Celery().
        ```
    Note that the YAML you provide here must align with the configuration with which the Celery
    workers on which you hope to run were started. If, for example, you point the executor at a
    different broker than the one your workers are listening to, the workers will never be able to
    pick up tasks for execution.

    In deployments where the celery_k8s_job_executor is used all appropriate celery and dagster_celery
    commands must be invoked with the <cite>-A dagster_celery_k8s.app</cite> argument.
