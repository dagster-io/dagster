A graph is a set of interconnected [ops](ops) or sub-graphs. While individual ops typically perform simple tasks, ops can be assembled into a graph to accomplish complex tasks.

It is not necessary to use graphs to use Dagster; most Dagster users will never need to create graphs directly. For more information on graphs, including op graphs, nesting op graphs, and dynamic op graphs, see the [legacy Dagster documentation](https://legacy-docs.dagster.io/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).
