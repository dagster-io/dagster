In Dagster, partitioning is a powerful technique for managing large datasets, improving pipeline performance, and enabling incremental processing. This guide will help you understand how to implement data partitioning in your Dagster projects.

There are several ways to partition your data in Dagster:

- [Time-based partitioning](#time-based), for processing data in specific time intervals
- [Static partitioning](#static-partitions), for dividing data based on predefined categories
- [Two-dimensional partitioning](#two-dimensional-partitions), for partitioning data along two different axes simultaneously
- [Dynamic partitioning](#dynamic-partitions), for creating partitions based on runtime information

## Time-based partitions \{#time-based}

A common use case for partitioning is to process data that can be divided into time intervals, such as daily logs or monthly reports.

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/data-modeling/partitioning/time_based_partitioning.py" language="python" />

## Partitions with predefined categories \{#static-partitions}

Sometimes you have a set of predefined categories for your data. For instance, you might want to process data separately for different regions.

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/data-modeling/partitioning/static_partitioning.py" language="python" />

## Two-dimensional partitions \{#two-dimensional-partitions}

Two-dimensional partitioning allows you to partition data along two different axes simultaneously. This is useful when you need to process data that can be categorized in multiple ways. For example:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/data-modeling/partitioning/two_dimensional_partitioning.py" language="python" />

In this example:

- Using `MultiPartitionsDefinition`, the `two_dimensional_partitions` is defined with two dimensions: `date` and `region`
- The partition key would be: `2024-08-01|us`
- The `daily_regional_sales_data` and `daily_regional_sales_summary` assets are defined with the same two-dimensional partitioning scheme
- The `daily_regional_sales_schedule` runs daily at 1:00 AM, processing the previous day's data for all regions. It uses `MultiPartitionKey` to specify partition keys for both date and region dimensions, resulting in three runs per day, one for each region.

## Partitions with dynamic categories \{#dynamic-partitions}

Sometimes you don't know the partitions in advance. For example, you might want to process new regions that are added in your system. In these cases, you can use dynamic partitioning to create partitions based on runtime information.

Consider this example:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/data-modeling/partitioning/dynamic_partitioning.py" language="python" title="Dynamic partitioning" />

Because the partition values are unknown in advance, `DynamicPartitionsDefinition` is used to define the partition. Then, the `all_regions_sensor` TODO: incomplete sentence

In this example:

- Because the partition values are unknown in advance, `DynamicPartitionsDefinition` is used to define `region_partitions`
- When triggered, the `all_regions_sensor` will dynamically add all regions to the partition set. Once it kicks off runs, it will dynamically kick off runs for all regions. In this example, that would be six times; one for each region.
