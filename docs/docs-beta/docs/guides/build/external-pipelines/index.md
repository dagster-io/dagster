Dagster Pipes provides a powerful mechanism for invoking code outside of Dagster, while providing all the benefits of scheduling, reporting, and observability of native Dagster pipelines. While Dagster is written in Python, you can run code in other languages and send information back to Dagster.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to invoke non-Dagster code through Pipes.

This documentation assumes familiarity with [Dagster assets](/guides/build/assets).

## Setting up an asset that invokes your external code

To set up invoking code outside of Dagster, you first need to set up an asset.  We can invoke the external code within the asset function by using a Dagster Pipes client resource.

This external code is not required to know anything about Dagster.  It can even be a process running a different language on a remote machine - the only requirement is that it can be triggered from Python.

In the following example, our external code is in a Python script that we invoke within a Dagster asset.

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/external-systems/pipes/external_code_opaque.py" language="python" title="/usr/bin/external_code.py" />
<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/external-systems/pipes/asset_wrapper.py" language="python" title="Asset invoking external compute using Dagster Pipes" />

Materializing this asset in Dagster from the UI or from a sensor/schedule will kick off the execution of that external code.

## Sending logs and metadata back to Dagster from external code

Dagster Pipes also establishes a protocol for external code to optionally send back log and metadata back to Dagster.  A Python client for this protocol is available as part of the [`dagster-pipes`](/api/python-api/libraries/dagster-pipes) package.  To send back log and metadata back to Dagster, we can create a `PipesContext` object within our external code:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/external-systems/pipes/external_code_data_passing.py" language="python" title="/usr/bin/external_code.py" />

The logs sent back using the `PipesContext` will be visible in the structured logs of that asset materialization's run, and the materialization metadata will be reflected in the asset history.
