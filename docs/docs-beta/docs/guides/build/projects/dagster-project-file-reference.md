This reference contains details about [default](#default-files) and [configuration](#configuration-files) files in a Dagster project, including:

- File names
- What the files do
- Where files should be located in a project directory
- Resources for structuring your Dagster project

## Default files

The following demonstrates a Dagster project using the default project skeleton, generated by the `dagster project scaffold` command:

```shell
.
├── README.md
├── my_dagster_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├──  assets.py
│   └──  definitions.py
├── my_dagster_project_tests
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tox.ini
```

:::note

While this specific example uses a project created by scaffolding, projects created [using an official example](creating-a-new-project#using-an-official-example) will also contain these files. In official examples, `assets.py` will be a subdirectory instead of a Python file.

:::

Let's take a look at what each of these files and directories does:

### my_dagster_project/ directory

This is a Python module that contains Dagster code. This directory also contains the following:

| File/Directory | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `__init__.py`  | A file required in a Python package. For more information, see the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages). |
| `assets.py` | A Python module that contains asset definitions. **Note:** As your project grows, we recommend organizing assets in sub-modules. For example, you can put all analytics-related assets in a `my_dagster_project/assets/analytics/` directory and use <PyObject section="assets" module="dagster" object="load_assets_from_package_module" /> in the top-level definitions to load them, rather than needing to manually add assets to the top-level definitions every time you define one.<br /><br /> Similarly, you can also use <PyObject section="assets" module="dagster" object="load_assets_from_modules" /> to load assets from single Python files. |
| `definitions.py` | The `definitions.py` file includes a <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="Definitions" /> object that contains all the definitions defined within your project. A definition can be an asset, a job, a schedule, a sensor, or a resource. This allows Dagster to load the definitions in a module.<br /><br />To learn about other ways to deploy and load your Dagster code, see the [code locations documentation](/guides/deploy/code-locations/) |

### my_dagster_project_tests/ directory

A Python module that contains tests for `my_dagster_project`.

### README.md file

A description and starter guide for your Dagster project.

### pyproject.toml file

A file that specifies package core metadata in a static, tool-agnostic way.

This file includes a `tool.dagster` section which references the Python module with your Dagster definitions defined and discoverable at the top level. This allows you to use the `dagster dev` command to load your Dagster code without any parameters. For more information. see the [code locations documentation](/guides/deploy/code-locations/).

**Note:** `pyproject.toml` was introduced in [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) and meant to replace `setup.py`, but we may still include a `setup.py` for compatibility with tools that do not use this spec.

### setup.py file

A build script with Python package dependencies for your new project as a package. Use this file to specify dependencies.

Note: If using Dagster+, add `dagster-cloud` as a dependency.

### setup.cfg

An ini file that contains option defaults for `setup.py` commands.

## Configuration files

Depending on your use case or if you're using Dagster+, you may also need to add additional configuration files to your project. Refer to the [Example project structures section](#example-project-structures) for a look at how these files might fit into your projects.

| File/Directory | Description | OSS | Dagster+ |
|----------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| dagster.yaml   | Configures your Dagster instance, including defining storage locations, run launchers, sensors, and schedules. For more information. including a list of use cases and available options, see the [`dagster.yaml`](/guides/deploy/dagster-yaml) reference.<br /><br />For [Dagster+ Hybrid deployments](/dagster-plus/deployment/deployment-types/hybrid/), this file can be used to customize the [Hybrid agent](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/settings/customizing-agent-settings). | Optional | Optional |
| dagster_cloud.yaml | Defines code locations for Dagster+. For more information, see the [`dagster_cloud.yaml` reference](/dagster-plus/deployment/code-locations/dagster-cloud-yaml). | Not applicable | Recommended |
| deployment_settings.yaml | Configures settings for full deployments in Dagster+, including run queue priority and concurrency limits. Refer to the Deployment settings reference for more info.<br /><br />**Note:** This file can be named anything, but we recommend choosing an easily understandable name. | Not applicable | Optional |
| workspace.yaml | Defines multiple code locations for local development or deploying to your infrastructure. For more information and available options, see the [`workspace.yaml` file reference](/guides/deploy/code-locations/workspace-yaml) | Optional | Not applicable |


## Example project structures

Using the default project skeleton, let's take a look at how some example Dagster projects would be structured in different scenarios.

:::note Configuration file location

With the exception of [`dagster_cloud.yaml`](/dagster-plus/deployment/code-locations/dagster-cloud-yaml), it's not necessary for configuration files to be located with your project files. These files typically need to be located in `DAGSTER_HOME`. For example, in larger deployments, `DAGSTER_HOME` and Dagster infrastructure configuration can be managed separately from the code locations they support.

### Local development

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Single code location">

For local development, a project with a single code location might look like this:

```shell
.
├── README.md
├── my_dagster_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├──  assets.py
│   └──  definitions.py
├── my_dagster_project_tests
├── dagster.yaml      ## optional, used for instance settings
├── pyproject.toml    ## optional, used to define the project as a module
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
└── tox.ini
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Multiple code locations">

For local development, a project with multiple code locations might look like this:

```shell
.
├── README.md
├── my_dagster_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├──  assets.py
│   └──  definitions.py
├── my_dagster_project_tests
├── dagster.yaml      ## optional, used for instance settings
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
├── tox.ini
└── workspace.yaml    ## defines multiple code locations
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Dagster Open Source deployment

Once you're ready to move from working locally to deploying Dagster to your infrastructure, use our [deployment guides](/guides/deploy/deployment-options/) to get up and running.

A Dagster project deployed to your infrastructure might look like this:

```shell
.
├── README.md
├── my_dagster_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├──  assets.py
│   └──  definitions.py
├── my_dagster_project_tests
├── dagster.yaml      ## optional, used for instance settings
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
├── tox.ini
└── workspace.yaml    ## defines multiple code locations
```

### Dagster+

Depending on the type of deployment you're using in Dagster+ - Serverless or Hybrid - your project structure might look slightly different. Click the tabs for more info.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Serverless deployment">

#### Serverless deployment

For a Dagster+ Serverless deployment, a project might look like this:
