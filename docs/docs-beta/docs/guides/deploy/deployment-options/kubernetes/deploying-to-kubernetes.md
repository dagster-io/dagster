This guide will walk you through how to run the Dagster-specific components of a Dagster production deployment on a Kubernetes cluster. This includes the Dagster daemon, a webserver to serve the Dagster UI, a PostgrSQL container, and your Dagster project user code.

Dagster provides [Helm charts](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/helm) for deploying Dagster that you can customize for your specific needs. For each Dagster component used by the Helm chart, Dagster publishes a corresponding image to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dagster).

  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Familiarity with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)**, and:
  - **To have Docker installed**. [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - **Access to a Docker image registry**, such as Amazon Web Services ECR or DockerHub. If you're following along on your local machine, this isn't required.
- **Familiarity with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/)**, and:
  - **To have `kubectl` installed**. [Kubernetes installation guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
  - **An existing Kubernetes cluster**. To follow along on your local machine, [install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) and turn on the included Kubernetes server.
- **Familiarity with [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/)**, and:
  - **To have Helm 3 installed**. [Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- A Dagster project to deploy. You can also use the example project:
  ```bash
  dagster project from-example --example deploy_k8s --name deploy_k8s
  ```

## Step 1: Write and build a Docker image containing your Dagster project
### Step 1.1: Write a Dockerfile
Next, you'll build a Docker image that contains your Dagster project and all of its dependencies. The Dockerfile should:
1. Copy your Dagster project into the image.
2. Install `dagster`, `dagster-postgres`, and `dagster-k8s`, along with any other libraries your project depends on. The example project has a dependency on `pandas` so it's included in the `pip install` in the following example Dockerfile.
3. Expose port 80, which we'll use to set up port-forwarding later.

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/deployment/kubernetes/Dockerfile" language="docker" title="Example Dockerfile" />


### Step 1.2: Build and push a Docker image

To build your Docker image, run the following command from the directory where your Dockerfile is located:

```bash
docker build . -t iris_analysis:1
```
This builds the Docker image from Step 1.1 and gives it the name `iris_analysis` and tag `1`. You can set custom values for both the name and the tag. We recommend that each time you rebuild your Docker image, you assign a new value for the tag to ensure that the correct image is used when running your code.


If you are using a Docker image registry, push the image to your registry. If you are following along on your local machine, you can skip this command.

```bash
docker push iris_analysis:1
```

If you are pushing your image to an image registry, you can find more information about this process in your registry's documentation:
- [Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html)
- [DockerHub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/quickstart/#step-5-build-and-push-a-container-image-to-docker-hub-from-your-computer)


## Step 2: Configure `kubectl` to point at a Kubernetes cluster
Before you can deploy Dagster, you need to configure `kubectl` to develop against the Kubernetes cluster where you want Dagster to be deployed.

If you are using Docker Desktop and the included Kubernetes server, you will need to create a context first. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster and context created for your Dagster deployment you can skip running this command.
```bash
kubectl config set-context dagster --namespace default --cluster docker-desktop --user=docker-desktop
```

Ensure that `kubectl` is using the correct context by running:
```bash
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```
Where `<context-name>` is the name of the context you want to use. For example, if you ran the preceding `kubectl config set-context` command, you will run
```bash
kubectl config use-context dagster
```

## Step 3: Add the Dagster Helm chart repository

Dagster publishes [Helm charts](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dagster/dagster) for deploying Dagster, with a new chart for each Dagster version.

To install the Dagster Helm charts, run the following command:

```bash
helm repo add dagster https://dagster-io.github.io/helm
```

If you have previously added the Dagster Helm charts, run the following command to update the repository:

```bash
helm repo update
```

## Step 4: Configure the Helm chart for your deployment

You will need to modify some values in Dagster's Helm chart to deploy your Dagster project.

### Step 4.1: Copy default Helm chart values into values.yaml

Run the following command to copy the values installed from the published Helm charts:

```bash
helm show values dagster/dagster > values.yaml
```

### Step 4.2: Modify the `values.yaml` file for your deployment
The `values.yaml` file contains configuration options you can set for your deployment. Different configuration options are explained in [inline comments in `values.yaml`](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dagster/dagster?modal=values).

To deploy your project, you'll need to set the following options:
- `dagster-user-deployments.deployments.name`, which should be a unique name for your deployment
- `dagster-user-deployments.deployments.image.name` and `dagster-user-deployments.deployments.image.tag`, which should be set to match the Docker image from Step 1
- `dagster-user-deployments.deployments.dagsterApiGrpcArgs`, which should be set to the arguments you would pass to `dagster api grpc` to [run a gRPC server for your project](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files#running-your-own-grpc-server).

If you are following this guide on your local machine, you will also need to set `pullPolicy: IfNotPresent`. This will use the local version of the image built in Step 1. However, in production use cases when your Docker images are pushed to image registries, this value should remain `pullPolicy: Always`.

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/deployment/kubernetes/minimal_values.yaml" language="yaml" title="Minimal changes to make to values.yaml" />

In this example, the image `name` and `tag` are set to `iris_analysis` and `1` to match the image that was pushed in Step 1. To run the gPRC server, the path to the Dagster project needs to be specified, so `--python-file` and `/iris_analysis/definitions.py` are set for `dagsterApiGrpcArgs`.


## Step 5: Install the Helm chart
Now that you have modified the Helm `values.yaml` file, you can install the changes in your Kubernetes cluster.

Run the following command to install the Helm chart and create a [release](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#three-big-concepts).

```bash
helm upgrade --install dagster dagster/dagster -f /path/to/values.yaml
```

:::note
If you want to run an older version of the Dagster system components, like the daemon and webserver, pass the `--version` flag to `helm upgrade` with the version of Dagster you are running. For example, if you want to run version `1.7.4` you'll run the command `helm upgrade --install dagster dagster/dagster -f /path/to/values.yaml --version 1.7.4`
:::

The `helm upgrade` command will launch several pods in your Kubernetes cluster. You can check the status of the pod with the command:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

It may take a few minutes before all pods are in a `RUNNING` state. If the `helm upgrade` was successful, you should see a `kubectl get pods` output similar to this:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                                              READY   STATUS      AGE
dagster-daemon-5787ccc868-nsvsg                                   1/1     Running     3m41s
dagster-webserver-7c5b5c7f5c-rqrf8                                1/1     Running     3m41s
dagster-dagster-user-deployments-iris-analysis-564cbcf9f-fbqlw    1/1     Running     3m41s
dagster-postgresql-0                                              1/1     Running     3m41s
```

<details>
  <summary>Debugging failed pods</summary>

If one of the pods is in an error state, you can view the logs using the command

```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```

For example, if the pod `dagster-webserver-7c5b5c7f5c-rqrf8` is in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, the logs can be viewed with the command

```
kubectl logs dagster-webserver-7c5b5c7f5c-rqrf8
```

</details>


## Step 6: Connect to your Dagster deployment and materialize your assets

### Step 6.1: Start port-forwarding to the webserver pod
Run the following command to set up port forwarding to the webserver pod:

```bash
DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default \
  -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=dagster,app.kubernetes.io/instance=dagster,component=dagster-webserver" \
  -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_POD_NAME 8080:80
```

This command gets the full name of the `webserver` pod from the output of `kubectl get pods`, and then sets up port forwarding with the `kubectl port-forward` command.

### Step 6.2: Visit your Dagster deployment

The webserver has been port-forwarded to `8080`, so you can visit the Dagster deployment by going to [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). You should see the Dagster landing page

![Screenshot of Dagster landing page](/images/guides/deploy/kubernetes/dagster-kubernetes-deploy.png)

### Step 6.3: Materialize an asset
In the Dagster UI, navigate to the Asset catalog and click the **Materialize** button to materialize an asset. Dagster will start a Kubernetes job to materialize the asset. You can introspect on the Kubernetes cluster to see this job:

```bash
$ kubectl get jobs
NAME                                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
dagster-run-5ee8a0b3-7ca5-44e6-97a6-8f4bd86ee630   1/1           4s         11s
```
