The **User settings** page in the [Dagster UI](webserver) allows you to define settings like your timezone and theme and enable experimental features.

## Accessing your settings & preferences

To access your settings and preferences:

- **In Dagster Open Source (OSS)**: Click the **gear icon** in the upper right corner of the UI
- **In Dagster+**: Click the **user menu (your icon) > User Settings** in the upper right corner of the UI

A window will display where you can define settings.

## Experimental feature settings

Use the toggles next to the features in the **Experimental features** section of your **User settings** to enable and disable new features. We'd love your feedback!
