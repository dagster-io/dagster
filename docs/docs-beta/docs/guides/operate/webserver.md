The Dagster webserver serves the Dagster UI, a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects. It also responds to GraphQL queries.

In the UI, you can inspect Dagster objects (ex: assets, jobs, schedules), launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

## Launching the webserver

The easiest way to launch the webserver from the command line during local development is to run:

```shell
dagster dev
```

This command launches both the Dagster webserver and the [Dagster daemon](/guides/deploy/execution/dagster-daemon), allowing you to start a full local deployment of Dagster from the command line.

The command will print out the URL you can access the UI from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

When invoked, the webserver will fetch definitions - such as assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, and resources - from a <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="Definitions" /> object in a Python module or package or the code locations configured in an open source deployment's [workspace files](/guides/deploy/code-locations/workspace-yaml). For more information, see the [code locations documentation](/guides/deploy/code-locations/).

You can also launch the webserver by itself from the command line by running:

```shell
dagster-webserver
```

Note that several Dagster features, like schedules and sensors, require the Dagster daemon to be running in order to function.

## Overview page

- **Description**: This page, also known as the "factory floor", provides a high-level look at the activity in your Dagster deployment, across all code locations. This includes information about runs, jobs, schedules, sensors, resources, and backfills, all of which can be accessed using the tabs on this page.
