Using the UI, you can monitor and operate sensors. The UI provides multiple views that help with observing sensor evaluations, skip reasons, and errors.

To view all sensors, navigate to **Overview > Sensors**. Here, you can start and stop sensors, and view their frequency, last tick, and last run:
