### About Jupyter

Fast iteration, the literate combination of arbitrary code with markdown blocks, and inline plotting make notebooks an indispensable tool for data science. The **Dagstermill** package makes it easy to run notebooks using the Dagster tools and to integrate them into data jobs with heterogeneous ops: for instance, Spark jobs, SQL statements run against a data warehouse, or arbitrary Python code.
