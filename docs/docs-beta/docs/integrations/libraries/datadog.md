While Dagster provides comprehensive monitoring and observability of the pipelines it orchestrates, many teams look to centralize all their monitoring across apps, processes and infrastructure using Datadog's 'Cloud Monitoring as a Service'. The `dagster-datadog` integration allows you to publish metrics to Datadog from within Dagster ops.

### Installation

pip install dagster-datadog
```
