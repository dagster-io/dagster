### About AWS ECR

AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. AWS ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), simplifying your development to production workflow. With ECR, you can securely store and manage your container images and easily integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines. AWS ECR provides high availability and scalability, ensuring that your container images are always available when you need them.
