### About AWS Athena

AWS Athena is a serverless, interactive query service that allows you to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is easy to use; point to your data in Amazon S3, define the schema, and start querying using standard SQL. Most results are delivered within seconds. With Athena, there are no infrastructure setups, and you pay only for the queries you run. It scales automatically—executing queries in parallel—so results are fast, even with large datasets and complex queries.
