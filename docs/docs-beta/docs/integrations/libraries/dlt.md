This integration allows you to use [dlt](https://dlthub.com/) to easily ingest and replicate data between systems through Dagster.

:::note

This integration is currently **experimental**.

:::

### Installation

```bash
pip install dagster-dlt
```

### Example

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/integrations/dlt.py" language="python" />

:::note

If you are using the [sql_database](https://dlthub.com/docs/api_reference/sources/sql_database/__init__#sql_database) source, consider setting `defer_table_reflect=True` to reduce database reads. By default, the Dagster daemon will refresh definitions roughly every minute, which will query the database for resource definitions.

It offers features like secret management, data structure conversion, incremental updates, and pre-built sources and destinations, simplifying the process of loading messy data into well-structured datasets.
