This guide is applicable to Dagster+.

:::

In this article, we'll walk you through setting up branch deployments with a general continuous integration (CI) or git platform, using the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/dagster-cloud-cli/).

Using this approach to branch deployments may be a good fit if:

- You don't use GitHub for version control
- You use an alternate CI platform
- You want full control over Branch Deployment configuration

**If you use GitHub for version control or want Dagster to automate branch deployments**, see "[Setting up branch deployments](setting-up-branch-deployments)" and choose the GitHub tab.

## Prerequisites

Using Branch Deployments requires setting up two components: the Branch Deployment agent and CI platform. You'll need:

- **Organization Admin** permissions in Dagster+
- To install the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/dagster-cloud-cli/installing-and-configuring)
- The ability to configure your CI platform
- The ability to run a new agent in your infrastructure. This isn't required if you're using [Serverless deployment](/dagster-plus/deployment/deployment-types/serverless/).

## Step 1: Generate a Dagster+ agent token

In this step, you'll generate a token for the Dagster+ agent. The Dagster+ agent will use this to authenticate to the agent API.

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ instance.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Organization Settings**.
3. In the **Organization Settings** page, click the **Tokens** tab.
3. Click the **+ Create agent token** button.
4. After the token has been created, click **Reveal token**.
5. Copy the token somewhere safe, since you'll need it to complete the setup.

## Step 2: Create and configure an agent

:::note

If you're using Serverless deployment, this step isn't required. Skip to [step 3](#step-3-create-a-branch-deployment-using-the-dagster-cloud-cli)

:::

While you can use your existing production agent, we recommend creating a dedicated branch deployment agent. This ensures that your production instance isn't negatively impacted by the workload associated with branch deployments.

Using the tabs, select your agent type to view instructions.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Amazon ECS">

1. **Deploy an ECS agent to serve your branch deployments**. Follow the [ECS agent](/dagster-plus/deployment/deployment-types/hybrid/amazon-ecs/) setup guide, making sure to set the **Enable Branch Deployments** parameter if using the CloudFormation template. If you are running an existing agent, follow the [upgrade guide](/dagster-plus/deployment/deployment-types/hybrid/amazon-ecs/upgrading-cloudformation) to ensure your template is up-to-date. Then, turn on the **Enable Branch Deployments** parameter.

2. **Create a private [Amazon Elastic Registry (ECR) repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).** Refer to the [AWS ECR documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-create.html) for instructions.

   After the repository has been created, navigate back to the list of [ECR repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).

   In the list, locate the repository and its **URI**:

   ![Highlighted repository URI in the AWS ECR console](/images/dagster-plus/branch-deployments/aws-ecr-uri.png)

3. [**Create an IAM user.**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) This user must:

   - Have push access to the ECR repository, and
   - Have programmatic access to AWS using an [access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)

   After the user is created, save the **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** values shown on the confirmation page:

   ![Highlighted repository URI in the AWS ECR console](/images/dagster-plus/branch-deployments/aws-iam-user-keys.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Docker">

1. Set up a new Docker agent. Refer to the [Docker agent setup guide](/dagster-plus/deployment/deployment-types/hybrid/docker/) for instructions.
2. After the agent is set up, modify the `dagster.yaml` file as follows:

   - Set the `dagster_cloud_api.branch_deployments` field to `true`
   - Remove any `deployment` field(s)

   For example:

   ```yaml
   # dagster.yaml

   instance_class:
     module: dagster_cloud.instance
     class: DagsterCloudAgentInstance

   dagster_cloud_api:
     agent_token: <YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN>
     branch_deployments: true ## true enables branch deployments

   user_code_launcher:
     module: dagster_cloud.workspace.docker
     class: DockerUserCodeLauncher
     config:
       networks:
         - dagster_cloud_agent
       server_ttl:
         enabled: true
         ttl_seconds: 7200 #2 hours
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Kubernetes">

1. Set up a new Kubernetes agent. Refer to the [Kubernetes agent setup guide](/dagster-plus/deployment/deployment-types/hybrid/kubernetes/configuration) for instructions.

2. After the agent is set up, modify your Helm values file to include the following:

   ```yaml
   dagsterCloud:
     branchDeployments: true
   ---
   workspace:
     serverTTL:
       enabled: true
       ttlSeconds: 7200
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Create a branch deployment using the dagster-cloud CLI

Next, you'll create a branch deployment using the `dagster-cloud` CLI. When the state of a branch or merge request is updated, Dagster+ first expects these steps to occur:

1. A new image containing your code and requirements is built on the branch. Refer to the [Dagster code requirements guide](/dagster-plus/deployment/code-locations/).

2. The new image is pushed to a Docker registry accessible to your agent. **Note**: The following examples assume the registry URL and image tag are stored in the `LOCATION_REGISTRY_URL` and `IMAGE_TAG` environment variables, respectively.

After the above has occurred:

1. Use the `dagster-cloud` CLI to create a branch deployment associated with the branch, as follows:

   ```shell
   BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(
       dagster-cloud branch-deployment create-or-update \
           --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
           --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \ # Agent token from Step 1
           --git-repo-name $REPOSITORY_NAME \ # Git repository name
           --branch-name $BRANCH_NAME \ # Git branch name
           --commit-hash $COMMIT_SHA \ # Latest commit SHA on the branch
           --timestamp $TIMESTAMP # UTC unixtime timestamp of the latest commit
   )
   ```

   One or more additional parameters can optionally be supplied to the `create-or-update` command to enhance the Branch Deployments UI in Dagster+:

   ```shell
   BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(
       dagster-cloud branch-deployment create-or-update \
           --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
           --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \
           --git-repo-name $REPOSITORY_NAME \
           --branch-name $BRANCH_NAME \
           --commit-hash $COMMIT_SHA \
           --timestamp $TIMESTAMP
           --code-review-url $PR_URL \ # URL to review the given changes, e.g.
                # Pull Request or Merge Request
           --code-review-id $INPUT_PR \ # Alphanumeric ID for the given set of changes
           --pull-request-status $PR_STATUS \ # A status, one of `OPEN`, `CLOSED`,
                # or `MERGED`, that describes the set of changes
           --commit-message $MESSAGE \ # The message associated with the latest commit
           --author-name $NAME \ # A display name for the latest commit's author
           --author-email $EMAIL \ # An email for the latest commit's author
           --author-avatar-url $AVATAR_URL # An avatar URL for the latest commit's author
           --base-deployment-name $BASE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME # The main deployment that will be compared against. Default is 'prod'
   )
   ```

   If the command is being executed from the context of the git repository, you can alternatively pull this metadata from the repository itself:

   ```shell
   BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(
       dagster-cloud branch-deployment create-or-update \
           --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
           --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \
           --git-repo-name $REPOSITORY_NAME \
           --branch-name $BRANCH_NAME \
           --read-git-state # Equivalent to passing --commit-hash, --timestamp
                            # --commit-message, --author-name, --author-email
   )
   ```

2. Deploy the code to the branch deployment:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud deployment add-location \
       --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
       --deployment $BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
       --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \
       --location-file $LOCATION_FILE \
       --location-name $LOCATION_NAME \
       --image "${LOCATION_REGISTRY_URL}:${IMAGE_TAG}" \
       --commit-hash "${COMMIT_SHA}" \
       --git-url "${GIT_URL}"
   ```

   Refer to the [Code location guide](/dagster-plus/deployment/code-locations) for more info on how a location's details are specified.

## Step 4: Access the branch deployment

Now that Branch Deployments are configured, you can check out the preview in Dagster+.

Click the **deployment switcher** to view your workspace's branch deployments:
