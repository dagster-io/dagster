The [System for Cross-domain Identity Management specification](https://scim.cloud/) (SCIM) is a standard designed to manage user identity information. When enabled in Dagster+, SCIM allows you to efficiently and easily manage users in your Identity Provider (IdP) - in this case, Okta - and sync their information to Dagster+.

In this guide, we'll walk you through configuring [Okta SCIM provisioning](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/scim/) for Dagster+.

## About this feature

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Supported features">

### Supported features

With Dagster+'s Okta SCIM provisioning feature, you can:

- **Create users**. Users that are assigned to the Dagster+ application in the IdP will be automatically added to your Dagster+ organization.
- **Update user attributes.** Updating a user's name or email address in the IdP will automatically sync the change to your user list in Dagster+.
- **Remove users.** Deactivating or unassigning a user from the Dagster+ application in the IdP will remove them from the Dagster+ organization
{/* - **Push user groups.** Groups and their members in the IdP can be pushed to Dagster+ as [Teams](/dagster-plus/account/managing-users/managing-teams). */}
- **Push user groups.** Groups and their members in the IdP can be pushed to Dagster+ as
    [Teams](/dagster-plus/features/authentication-and-access-control/rbac/teams).

Refer to [Okta's SCIM documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/scim/) for more information about Okta's SCIM offering.

- **To have set up Okta SSO for Dagster+.** Refer to the [Okta SSO setup guide](//dagster-plus/features/authentication-and-access-control/sso/okta-sso) for more info.

## Next steps

That's it! Once Okta successfully syncs users to Dagster+, synced users will have a 'synced' icon next to them in the Dagster+ users page:
