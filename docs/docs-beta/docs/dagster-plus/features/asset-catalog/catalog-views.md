Catalog views enable you to filter down your view of the Dagster Asset catalog in Dagster+, allowing you to toggle between sets of assets that you care about most.

You can save catalog views for your own use or share them with your team. For example, you could create views that:

- Filter assets based on ownership to only show those owned by your team
- Filter assets based on the asset kind to give insight into the status of your ELT ingestion
- Display assets with a "gold" medallion tag, showing only refined, high-quality data that analysts can use with confidence

In this guide, you'll learn how to create, access, and share catalog views with others.

Catalog views require **Organization Admin**, **Admin**, or **Editor** permissions on Dagster+.

## Creating catalog views

To view the Dagster+ Asset catalog, use the **Catalog** button on the top navigation.

In any Dagster+ catalog page, you can access the current catalog view, or create a new catalog view with the catalog view dropdown at the top left of the screen. By default, this button is labeled **All assets**, and has a globe icon.

To create a new catalog view, you have two options:
- [Create a new catalog view from scratch](#creating-a-new-catalog-view-from-scratch), from the catalog view menu.
- [Create a new catalog view from your current set of filters](#creating-a-new-catalog-view-from-your-current-set-of-filters).
