  - View all assets in your Dagster deployment
  - View details about a specific asset by clicking on it
  - Search assets by asset key, compute kind, asset group, code location, tags, owners, and more
  - Access the global asset lineage
  - Reload definitions

To access the asset catalog, click **Catalog** in the top navigation.
