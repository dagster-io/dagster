## Environment variables and secrets

Using the `container_context.docker.env_vars` property, you can include environment variables and secrets in the Docker container associated with a specific code location. For example:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml
locations:
  - location_name: cloud-examples
    image: dagster/dagster-cloud-examples:latest
    code_source:
      package_name: dagster_cloud_examples
    container_context:
      docker:
        env_vars:
          - DATABASE_NAME
          - DATABASE_USERNAME=hooli_testing
```

The `container_context.docker.env_vars` property is a list, where each item can be either `KEY` or `KEY=VALUE`. If only `KEY` is specified, the value will be pulled from the local environment.

Refer to the following guides for more info about environment variables:
