This guide will walk you through setting up a new repository for your Dagster code, setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions backed by Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploying your code to your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

This guide assumes you already have an AKS agent running. You can follow along [here](aks-agent) if you still need to set up an AKS agent.

## Prerequisites

This guide will use a Github repository to store the Dagster code, and GitHub Actions to deploy the code to Azure Container Registry. If you need to use another CI/CD provider, such as Azure DevOps, the steps here will need to be adapted. For more information on configuring CI/CD using the `dagster-cloud` CLI, see "[Configuring CI/CD for your project](/dagster-plus/features/ci-cd/configuring-ci-cd#non-github).

- The azure CLI installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- A GitHub account, and the ability to run GitHub Actions workflows in a repository.

## Step 1: Creating a repository for Dagster code

We'll create a new repository based on the [Dagster+ hybrid quickstart repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart). We'll go through these steps using a brand new repository in GitHub, but you should be able to adapt these steps to an existing repository or other version control systems.

First, [create a new repository in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository). Going forward, we'll refer to this repository as `dagster-plus-code`.

Next, we'll run a few commands which clone both our new repository and the Dagster+ hybrid quickstart repository to our local machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> dagster-plus-code
git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart.git
```

We'll copy the contents of the `dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart` repository into our `dagster-plus-code` repository, and commit the changes.

```bash
rsync -av --exclude='.git' dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/ dagster-plus-code/
cd dagster-plus-code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push
```

### Project structure

The project has the following structure:

```plaintext
├── .github
│   └── workflows
│       └── dagster-cloud-deploy.yml # GitHub Actions workflow for re-deploying code location
├── .vscode # Standard VSCode settings for working with a Dagster repository
├── Dockerfile # Dockerfile for building the user code image
├── README.md
├── dagster_cloud.yaml # Configuration file describing all code locations in the repository
├── pyproject.toml # Python project configuration file for the code location
├── quickstart_etl # Python package containing the user code
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── assets
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── hackernews.py
│   └── definitions.py
├── quickstart_etl_tests # User code tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_assets.py
├── setup.cfg
└── setup.py
```

## Step 2: Setting up an Azure Container Registry

Next, we'll set up an Azure Container Registry to store our Docker images. We'll use the Azure CLI to create the registry.

```bash
az login
az acr create --resource-group <your_resource_group> --name <your-acr-name> --sku Basic
```

Then, we'll make images from our ACR available to our AKS cluster.

```bash
az aks update -n <your-cluster-name> -g <your_resource_group> --attach-acr <your-acr-name>
```

## Step 3: Setting up GitHub Actions

Now, we'll set up a Github Actions workflow to build and push our Docker image to Azure Container Registry.

We already have a GitHub Actions workflow in our repository, located at `.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml`. This workflow will build the Docker image, push it to ACR, and update the code location in Dagster+. To get it working with your repository, you'll need to do a few things.

#### Generate Azure credentials

First, we'll need to generate a service principal for GitHub Actions to use to authenticate with Azure. We'll use the Azure CLI to create the service principal.

```bash
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions-acr" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<your_azure_subscription_id>/resourceGroups/<your_resource_group>/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/<your_acr_name>
```

This command will output a JSON object with the service principal details. Make sure to save the `appId` and `password` values - we'll use them in the next step.

### Add secrets to your repository

We'll add the service principal details as secrets in our repository. Go to your repository in GitHub, and navigate to `Settings` -> `Secrets`. Add the following secrets:

- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN`: An agent token. For more details see [Managing agent tokens](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/tokens/agent-tokens).
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: The `appId` from the service principal JSON object.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: The `password` from the service principal JSON object.

### Update the GitHub Actions workflow

For this step, open `.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml` in your repository with your preferred text editor to perform the changes below.

In the `env` section of the workflow, update the following variables:

- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION`: The name of your Dagster Cloud organization.
- `IMAGE_REGISTRY`: The URL of your Azure Container Registry: `<your-acr-name>.azurecr.io`.

We'll update the workflow to use the Azure Container Registry by uncommenting its section and providing the principal details. It should look like this:

```yaml
# Azure Container Registry (ACR)
# https://github.com/docker/login-action#azure-container-registry-acr
- name: Login to Azure Container Registry
  if: steps.prerun.outputs.result != 'skip'
  uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    registry: ${{ env.IMAGE_REGISTRY }}
    username: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
    password: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}
```

Finally, update the tags in the "Build and upload Docker image" step to match the full URL of your image in ACR:

```yaml
- name: Build and upload Docker image for "quickstart_etl"
  if: steps.prerun.outputs.result != 'skip'
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    context: .
    push: true
    tags: ${{ env.IMAGE_REGISTRY }}/<image-name>:${{ env.IMAGE_TAG }}
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

### Update the `dagster_cloud.yaml` build configuration to use the Azure Container Registry

Edit the `dagster_cloud.yaml` file in the root of your repository. Update the `build` section to use the Azure Container Registry, and provide an image name specific to the code location. This must match the registry and image name used in the previous step.

```yaml
locations:
  - location_name: quickstart_etl
    code_source:
      package_name: quickstart_etl.definitions
    build:
      directory: ./
      registry: <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/<image-name>
```

### Push and run the workflow

Now, commit and push the changes to your repository. The GitHub Actions workflow should run automatically. You can check the status of the workflow in the `Actions` tab of your repository.

![GitHub Actions workflow for deploying user code to Azure Container Registry](/images/dagster-plus/deployment/azure/github-actions-workflow.png)

When the workflow completes, you should see the new code location in Dagster+. Navigate to the `Status` page, and click the `Code Locations` tab. You should see your new code location listed.

## Next steps

Now that you have your code location deployed, you can follow the guide [here](blob-compute-logs) to set up logging in your AKS cluster.
