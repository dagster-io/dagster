# Build your first ETL pipeline

In this tutorial, you'll build an ETL pipeline with Dagster that:

- Imports sales data to DuckDB
- Transforms data into reports
- Runs scheduled reports automatically
- Generates one-time reports on demand

## You will learn to:

- Set up a Dagster project with the recommended project structure
- Create and materialize assets
- Create and materialize dependant assets
- Ensure data quality with asset checks
- Create and materialize partitioned assets
- Automate the pipeline
- Create and materialize a sensor asset
- Refactor your project when it becomes more complex

  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- Basic Python knowledge
- Python 3.9+ installed on your system. Refer to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/installation) for information.
- Familiarity with SQL and Python data manipulation libraries, such as Pandas.
- Understanding of data pipelines and the extract, transform, and load process.
</details>


## Step 1: Set up your Dagster environment

First, set up a new Dagster project.

1. Open your terminal and create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir dagster-etl-tutorial
   cd dagster-etl-tutorial
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
   ```bash
   python -m venv dagster_tutorial
   source dagster_tutorial/bin/activate
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
   ```bash
   python -m venv dagster_tutorial
   dagster_tutorial\Scripts\activate
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. Install Dagster and the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install dagster dagster-webserver pandas dagster-duckdb
   ```

## Step 2: Create the Dagster project structure

Run the following command to create the project directories and files for this tutorial:

   ```bash 
      dagster project from-example --example getting_started_etl_tutorial
   ```

Your project should have this structure:
{/* vale off */}
```
dagster-etl-tutorial/
├── data/
│   └── products.csv
│   └── sales_data.csv
│   └── sales_reps.csv
│   └── sample_request/
│       └── request.json
├── etl_tutorial/
│   └── definitions.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── setup.cfg
├── setup.py
```
{/* vale on */}

:::info
Dagster has several example projects you can install depending on your use case. To see the full list, run `dagster project list-examples`. For more information on the `dagster project` command, see the [API documentation](https://docs-preview.dagster.io/api/cli#dagster-project).

### Dagster project structure

#### dagster-etl-tutorial root directory

In the `dagster-etl-tutorial` root directory, there are three configuration files that are common in Python package management. These files manage dependencies and identify the Dagster modules in the project.
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| pyproject.toml | This file is used to specify build system requirements and package metadata for Python projects. It is part of the Python packaging ecosystem. |
| setup.cfg | This file is used for configuration of your Python package. It can include metadata about the package, dependencies, and other configuration options. |
| setup.py | This script is used to build and distribute your Python package. It is a standard file in Python projects for specifying package details. |

#### etl_tutorial directory

This is the main directory where you will define your assets, jobs, schedules, sensors, and resources.
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| definitions.py | This file is typically used to define jobs, schedules, and sensors. It organizes the various components of your Dagster project. This allows Dagster to load the definitions in a module. |

#### data directory

The data directory contains the raw data files for the project. We will reference these files in our software-defined assets in the next step of the tutorial.

## Step 3: Launch the Dagster webserver

To make sure Dagster and its dependencies were installed correctly, navigate to the project root directory and start the Dagster webserver:"

   ```bash
   dagster dev
   ```
