# Dagster Docs - Beta

This is the home of the Dagster documentation. The documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

---

## Overview of the docs

- `./src` contains custom components, styles, themes, and layouts.
- `./content-templates` contains the templates for the documentation pages.
- `./docs/` is the source of truth for the documentation.
- `/examples/docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/` contains code examples for the documentation. Some code examples also live in `/examples/` and `/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/`.

The docs are organized into the following sections:

- Docs - includes content from [getting-started](./docs/getting-started/), [etl-pipeline-tutorial](./docs/etl-pipeline-tutorial/), [guides](./docs/guides/), and [about](./docs/about/)
- [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials/)
- [Integrations](./docs/integrations/)
- [Dagster+](./docs/dagster-plus/)
- [API reference](./docs/api/)

`sidebar.ts` and `docusaurus.config.ts` are the main configuration files for the documentation.

For formatting guidelines, see the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

## Installation

The site uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management. Do not install yarn using `npm`.
The latest instructions for installing yarn can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

This is a recommended setup:

```
brew upgrade node
corepack enable
yarn install
```

The docs site also uses [Vale](https://vale.sh/) to check for issues in the documentation.

Install Vale with:

```bash
brew install vale
```

or

```bash
pip install vale
```

---

## Local development

To start the local development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. Access the website at [http://localhost:3050](http://localhost:3050).

### Linters

To check the documentation for different issues, use the following:

```bash
## Lints all content, applies lint autofixes and prettier changes
yarn lint

## Lints documentation content using Vale Server
## Checks for style guide adherence, grammar, spelling, etc.
yarn vale
yarn vale /path/to/file      ## check individual file
yarn vale --no-wrap          ## remove wrapping from output
```

---

## Build

To build the site for production:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service. This also checks for any broken links in the documentation. Note that you will need to store Algolia credentials in local environment variables to build the site for production.

---

## Deployment

This site is built and deployed using Vercel.

### API documentation

API documentation is built in Vercel by overriding the _Build Command_ to the following:

```sh
yarn sync-api-docs && yarn build
```

This runs the `scripts/vercel-sync-api-docs.sh` script which builds the MDX files using the custom `sphinx-mdx-builder`, and copies the resulting MDX files to `docs/api/python-api`.

---

## Search

Algolia search is used for search results on the website, as configured in `docusaurus.config.ts`.

The following environment variables must be configured in Vercel:

- `ALGOLIA_APP_ID`
- `ALGOLIA_API_KEY`
- `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`

These variables are not loaded when `process.env.ENV === 'development'`.
