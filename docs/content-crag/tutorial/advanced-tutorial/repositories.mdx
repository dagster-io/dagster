# Advanced: Organizing Jobs in Repositories & Workspaces

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/advanced/repositories/" />

In all of the examples we've seen so far, we've specified a file (`-f`) or a module (`-m`) in order to tell the CLI tools how to load a job, e.g.:

```bash
dagit -f hello_cereal.py
dagster job execute -f hello_cereal.py
```

But most of the time, especially when working on long-running projects with other people, we will want to be able to target many jobs at once with our tools.

Dagster provides the concept of a repository, a collection of jobs (and other definitions) that the Dagster tools can target as a whole. Repositories are declared using the <PyObject
module="dagster" object="RepositoryDefinition" /> API as follows:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/repositories/repos.py startafter=start_repos_marker_0 endbefore=end_repos_marker_0
@repository
def hello_cereal_repository():
    return [hello_cereal_job, complex_job]
```

This method returns a list of items, each one of which can be a job, a schedule, or a sensor.

## Lazy Construction

Notice that this requires eager construction of all its member definitions. In large codebases, job construction time can be large. In these cases, it may behoove you to only construct them on demand. For that, you can also return a dictionary of function references, which are constructed on demand:

```python file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/repositories/lazy_repos.py startafter=start_lazy_repos_marker_0 endbefore=end_lazy_repos_marker_0
@repository
def hello_cereal_repository():
    # Note that we can pass a dict of functions, rather than a list of
    # job definitions. This allows us to construct jobs lazily,
    # if, e.g., initializing a job involves any heavy compute
    return {
        "jobs": {
            "hello_cereal_job": lambda: hello_cereal_job,
            "complex_job": lambda: complex_job,
        }
    }
```

Note that the name of the job in the `RepositoryDefinition` must match the name we declared for it in its `job` (the default is the function name). Don't worry, if these names don't match, you'll see a helpful error message.

## Repositories in Dagit

If you save this file as `repos.py`, you can then run the command line tools on it. Try running:

```bash
dagit -f repos.py
```

Now you can see the list of all jobs in the repo on the left:

## Workspaces

Loading repositories via the `-f` or `-m` options is actually just a convenience function. The underlying abstraction is the "workspace", which determines all of the available repositories available to Dagit.

We have a file format for building workspaces called `workspace.yaml`. It is a convenience: it prevents you from having to type the same `-f` or `-m` flag repeatedly. But as you'll see below it enables more capabilities.

The following config will load jobs from a file, just like the `-f` CLI option.

```YAML caption=workspace.yaml
load_from:
  - python_file: repos.py
```

Dagit will look for `workspace.yaml` in the current directory by default, so now you can launch Dagit from that directory with no arguments.

```bash
dagit
```

Use the `python_package` config option to load jobs from explicitly installed Python packages. For example, you can `pip install` our tutorial code snippets as a Python package:

```bash
pip install -e docs_snippets  # Run this in the `examples/` directory.
```

Then, you can configure your `workspace.yaml` to load jobs from this package.

```yaml file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/repositories/workspace.yaml
load_from:
  - python_package: docs_snippets_crag.intro_tutorial.advanced.repositories.repos
```

### Supporting multiple repositories

You can also use `workspace.yaml` to load multiple repositories. This can be useful for organization purposes, in order to group jobs and other artifacts by team.

```yaml file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/repositories/multi_repo_workspace.yaml
load_from:
  - python_package: docs_snippets_crag.intro_tutorial.advanced.repositories.repos
  - python_file: repos.py
```

Load it:

```bash
dagit -w multi_repo_workspace.yaml
```

And now you can switch between repositories in Dagit.

### Multi-environment repositories

Sometimes teams desire different Python versions or virtual environments. To support this, Dagster repositories each live in completely separate processes from each other, and tools like Dagit communicate with those repositories using a cross-process RPC protocol.

Via the workspace, you can configure a different executable_path for each of your repositories. For example:

```yaml file=/intro_tutorial/advanced/repositories/multi_python_env_workspace_example.yaml
load_from:
  - python_file:
      relative_path: "/path/to/team/pipelines.py"
      executable_path: "/path/to/team/virtualenv/bin/python"
  - python_package:
      package_name: "other_team_package"
      executable_path: "/path/to/other_/virtualenv/bin/python"
```

For this example to work, you need to change the executable paths to point a virtual environment available in your system, and point to a Python file or package that is available and loadable by that executable.
