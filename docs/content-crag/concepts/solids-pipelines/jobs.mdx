| <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" /> | The method used to create a job from a graph.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| <PyObject object="JobDefinition" />                   | A job definition.  Includes a graph, [resources](/concepts/resources), default [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema), tags, [hooks](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solid-hooks), and an executor. |

Dagster is built around the observation that any data DAG typically contains a logical core of transformation (the graph), which is reusable across a set of environments or scenarios. The graph usually needs to be "customized" for each environment, by plugging in configuration and services that are specific to that environment.

A Dagster _job_ is the combination of a graph and a set of [resources](/concepts/resources) and [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).  You can create multiple jobs from the same graph.  For example, you might build a development job that executes a graph against sample data and stores outputs in local files, as well as production job that executes the same graph against production data and stores outputs in a cloud data lake.

Jobs are the unit of execution and monitoring in Dagster deployments - the [Dagit UI](/concepts/dagit/dagit) centers on jobs.  Dagit makes it easy to view all the runs of each job in one place, as well as to manually kick off runs for a job.

You can define [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) to execute jobs at fixed intervals or define [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) to trigger them jobs when external changes occur. You can also launch jobs manually from Dagit, GraphQL APIs, or the command line.

## Automatic coercion of graphs to jobs

If your graph does not contain any ops that require resources, the simplest way to create a job is to do nothing at all.  I.e. you can directly include a graph in a repository, or target it from a schedule or sensor, and Dagster will automatically treat it as a job.

For example, if you define a graph, as below, and run `dagit -f <file_where_graph_is_defined>`, Dagit will show you a single job, which was created from the `do_stuff` graph.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/coerce_job.py
from dagster import graph, op


@op
def do_something():
    pass


@graph
def do_stuff():
    do_something()
```

Dagster can only coerce a graph into a job if none of the ops in the graph have required resource keys.

## `to_job`

If you want to supply resources, config, tags, hooks, or an executor to a job, you can invoke the <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" /> method of a graph to instantiate a job.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs.py
from dagster import ResourceDefinition, graph, op


@op(config_schema={"config_param": str}, required_resource_keys={"my_resource"})
def do_something(context):
    context.log.info("config_param: " + context.op_config["config_param"])
    context.log.info("my_resource: " + context.resources.my_resource)


@graph
def do_it_all():
    do_something()


do_it_all_job = do_it_all.to_job(
    config={"graph": {"do_something": {"config": {"config_param": "stuff"}}}},
    resource_defs={"my_resource": ResourceDefinition.hardcoded_resource("hello")},
)
```

## Including a job in a repository

You make jobs available to Dagit, GraphQLs, and the command line by including them inside [repositories](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories). If you include schedules or sensors in a repository, the repository will automatically include jobs that those schedules or sensors target.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/repo_with_job.py
from dagster import repository

from .jobs import do_it_all_job


@repository
def my_repo():
    return [do_it_all_job]
```

## Advanced job configuration

Ops and resources often accept [configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) that determines how they behave. By default, you supply configuration for these ops and resources at the time you launch the job.

When constructing a job, you can customize how that configuration will be satisfied, by passing a value to the `config` parameter of the <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" /> method.  The options are discussed below:

### Hardcoded configuration

You can supply a config dictionary to the `config` argument of <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" />. The supplied dictionary will be used to configure the job whenever the job is launched. It will show up in the Dagit Playground and can be overridden.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs_with_default_config.py
from dagster import graph, op


@op(config_schema={"config_param": str})
def do_something(context):
    context.log.info("config_param: " + context.op_config["config_param"])


@graph
def do_it_all():
    do_something()


do_it_all_with_default_config = do_it_all.to_job(
    config={"graph": {"do_something": {"config": {"config_param": "stuff"}}}},
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Will log "config_param: stuff"
    do_it_all_with_default_config.execute_in_process()
```

### Partitioned jobs

You can supply a <PyObject object="PartitionedConfig" /> to the `config` argument of <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" />. It defines a discrete set of "partitions", along with a function for generating config for a partition. You can configure a job run by selecting a partition.

For more information on how this works, take a look at the [Partitions concept page](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitions).

### Config mapping

You can supply a <PyObject object="ConfigMapping" /> to the `config` argument of <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" />. This allows you to expose a narrower config interface to your job.  Instead of needing to configure every op and resource individually when launching the job, you can supply a smaller number of values to the outer config, and the <PyObject object="ConfigMapping" /> can translate it into config for all the job's ops and resources.

```python file=/concepts/solids_pipelines/jobs_with_config_mapping.py
from dagster import config_mapping, graph, op


@op(config_schema={"config_param": str})
def do_something(context):
    context.log.info("config_param: " + context.op_config["config_param"])


@graph
def do_it_all():
    do_something()


@config_mapping(config_schema={"simplified_param": str})
def simplified_config(val):
    return {"graph": {"do_something": {"config": {"config_param": val["simplified_param"]}}}}


do_it_all_with_simplified_config = do_it_all.to_job(config=simplified_config)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Will log "config_param: stuff"
    do_it_all_with_simplified_config.execute_in_process(run_config={"simplified_param": "stuff"})
```
