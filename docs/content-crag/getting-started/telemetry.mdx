# Telemetry

As an open source project, we collect usage statistics to better understand how users engage with Dagster and to inform development priorities. Telemetry data will motivate projects such as adding functionality in frequently-used parts of the CLI and will help us understand adoption of new features.

We will not see or store any data that is processed within ops and graphs. We will not see or store op definitions (including generated context) or graph definitions (including resources).

The telemetry-instrumented functions are:

```python file=../../../python_modules/dagster/dagster/core/telemetry.py startafter=start_TELEMETRY_WHITELISTED_FUNCTIONS endbefore=end_TELEMETRY_WHITELISTED_FUNCTIONS
TELEMETRY_WHITELISTED_FUNCTIONS = {
    "_logged_execute_pipeline",
    "execute_execute_command",
    "execute_launch_command",
}
```

To see the logs we send, open `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs/` if `$DAGSTER_HOME` is set or `~/.dagster/logs/` if not set (after calling the instrumented functions).

If you'd like to opt-out, you can add the following to `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` (creating that file if necessary):

```yaml
telemetry:
  enabled: false
```
