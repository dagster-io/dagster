# Deploying Dagster to AWS

To deploy Dagster to AWS, EC2 or ECS can host Dagit, RDS can store runs and events, and S3 can act as an IO manager.

## Hosting Dagit or Dagster Daemon on EC2 or ECS

To host Dagit or Dagster Daemon on a bare VM or in Docker on EC2 or ECS, see [Running Dagster as a service](/deployment/guides/service).

### Example

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/deploy_ecs" />

This example demonstrates how you can use `docker-compose` to manage a Dagster deployment on ECS. It includes a Dagit container for loading and launching pipelines, a `dagster-daemon` container for managing a run queue and submitting runs from schedules and sensors, a postgres container for persistent storage, and a container with user pipeline code. The Dagster instance uses the EcsRunLauncher to launch each run in its own ECS task.

## Using RDS for run and event log storage

You can use a hosted RDS PostgreSQL database for your Dagster run/events data. You can do this by setting blocks in your `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` appropriately.

```python file=/deploying/dagster-pg.yaml
run_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.run_storage
  class: PostgresRunStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { database }
      port: { port }

event_log_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.event_log
  class: PostgresEventLogStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { db_name }
      port: { port }

schedule_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.schedule_storage
  class: PostgresScheduleStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { db_name }
      port: { port }
```

In this case, you'll want to ensure you provide the right connection strings for your RDS instance, and ensure that the node or container hosting Dagit is able to connect to RDS.

Be sure that this file is present, and _DAGSTER_HOME_ is set, on the node where Dagit is running.

Note that using RDS for run and event log storage does not require that Dagit be running in the cloud. If you are connecting a local Dagit instance to a remote RDS storage, double check that your local node is able to connect to RDS.

## Using S3 for IO Management

To enable parallel computation (e.g., with the multiprocessing or Dagster celery executors), you will need to configure persistent [IO Managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) -- for instance, using an S3 bucket to store intermediates.

You'll first need to need to use <PyObject module="dagster_aws.s3" object="s3_pickle_io_manager"/> as your IO Manager or customize your own persistent io managers (see [example](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#defining-an-io-manager)).

```python file=/deploying/aws/io_manager.py
from dagster_aws.s3.io_manager import s3_pickle_io_manager
from dagster_aws.s3.resources import s3_resource
from dagster import job, op, Out, Int


@op(out=Out(Int))
def my_op():
    return 1


@job(
    resource_defs={
        "io_manager": s3_pickle_io_manager,
        "s3": s3_resource,
    }
)
def my_job():
    my_op()
```

Then, add the following YAML block in your pipeline config:

```yaml file=/deploying/aws/io_manager.yaml
resources:
  io_manager:
    config:
      s3_bucket: my-cool-bucket
      s3_prefix: good/prefix-for-files-
```

The resource uses `boto` under the hood, so if you are accessing your private buckets, you will need to provide the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables or follow one of the other boto authentication methods.

With this in place, your pipeline runs will store intermediates on S3 in the location `s3://<bucket>/dagster/storage/<pipeline run id>/intermediates/<solid name>.compute`.
