# Deploying Dagster to GCP

To deploy Dagster to GCP, Google Compute Engine (GCE) can host Dagit, Google Cloud SQL can store runs and events, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) can act as an IO manager.

## Hosting Dagit or Dagster Daemon on GCE

To host Dagit or Dagster Daemon on a bare VM or in Docker on GCE, see [Running Dagster as a service](/deployment/guides/service).

## Using Cloud SQL for run and event log storage

We recommend launching a Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance for run and events data. You can configure Dagit to use Cloud SQL to run and events data by setting blocks in your `$DAGSTER_HOME/dagster.yaml` appropriately:

```python file=/deploying/dagster-pg.yaml
run_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.run_storage
  class: PostgresRunStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { database }
      port: { port }

event_log_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.event_log
  class: PostgresEventLogStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { db_name }
      port: { port }

schedule_storage:
  module: dagster_postgres.schedule_storage
  class: PostgresScheduleStorage
  config:
    postgres_db:
      username: { username }
      password: { password }
      hostname: { hostname }
      db_name: { db_name }
      port: { port }
```

In this case, you'll want to ensure you provide the right connection strings for your Cloud SQL instance, and that the node or container hosting Dagit is able to connect to Cloud SQL.

Be sure that this file is present, and _DAGSTER_HOME_ is set, on the node where Dagit is running.

Note that using Cloud SQL for run and event log storage does not require that Dagit be running in the cloud. If you are connecting a local Dagit instance to a remote Cloud SQL storage, double check that your local node is able to connect to Cloud SQL.

## Using GCS for IO Management

You'll probably also want to configure a GCS bucket to store intermediates via persistent [IO Managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers). This enables reexecution, review and audit of solid intermediate results, and cross-node cooperation (e.g., with the multiprocessing or Dagster celery executors).

You'll first need to need to use <PyObject module="dagster_gcp.gcs" object="gcs_pickle_io_manager"/> as your IO Manager or customize your own persistent io managers (see [example](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#defining-an-io-manager)).

```python file=/deploying/gcp/io_manager.py
from dagster import ModeDefinition
from dagster_gcp.gcs.io_manager import gcs_pickle_io_manager
from dagster_gcp.gcs.resources import gcs_resource

prod_mode = ModeDefinition(
    name="prod",
    resource_defs={"gcs": gcs_resource, "io_manager": gcs_pickle_io_manager},
)
```

Then, add the following YAML block in your pipeline config:

```yaml file=/deploying/gcp/io_manager.yaml
resources:
  io_manager:
    config:
      gcs_bucket: my-cool-bucket
      gcs_prefix: good/prefix-for-files-
```

With this in place, your pipeline runs will store intermediates on GCS in the location `gs://<bucket>/dagster/storage/<pipeline run id>/intermediates/<solid name>.compute`.
