Now that we have the raw data loaded into DuckDB, we need to create a [downstream asset](/guides/build/assets/defining-assets-with-asset-dependencies) that combines the upstream assets together. In this step, you will:

- Create a downstream asset
- Materialize that asset

## 1. Create a downstream asset

Now that we have all of our raw data loaded into DuckDB, our next step is to merge it together in a view composed of data from all three source tables.

To accomplish this in SQL, we will bring in our `sales_data` table and then left join on `sales_reps` and `products` on their respective id columns. Additionally, we will keep this view concise and only have relevant columns for analysis.

As you can see, the new `joined_data` asset looks a lot like our previous ones, with a few small changes. We put this asset into a different group. To make this asset dependent on the raw tables, we add the asset keys to the `deps` parameter in the asset definition.

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial_components/src/etl_tutorial_components/defs/assets.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_asset_joined_data"
  endBefore="end_asset_joined_data"
  title="src/etl_tutorial_components/defs/assets/py"
/>

In the Dagster UI, reload definitions and materialize the `joined_data` asset.
