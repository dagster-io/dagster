Data quality is critical in data pipelines. Inspecting individual assets ensures that data quality issues are caught before they affect the entire pipeline.

In Dagster, you define [asset checks](/guides/test/asset-checks) like you define assets. Asset checks run when an asset is materialized. In this step, you will:

- Define an asset check
- Execute that asset check in the UI

## 1. Define an asset check

Asset check can go in the `assets.py` file next to the asset we just defined. An asset check can be any logic we want. In our case we query the `joined_data` table created by our asset and ensure that `customer_id` is not null:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/src/etl_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_asset_check"
  endBefore="end_asset_check"
  title="src/etl_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
/>

:::info
The asset check is using the same `DuckDBResource` resource we defined for the asset. Resources can be shared across all objects in Dagster.

```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'base',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#4F43DD',
      'primaryTextColor': '#FFFFFF',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#231F1B',
      'lineColor': '#DEDDFF',
      'secondaryColor': '#BDBAB7',
      'tertiaryColor': '#FFFFFF'
    }
  }
}%%
  graph LR
    style DuckDB fill:#BDBAB7,stroke:#BDBAB7,stroke-width:2px

    Asset -.-> Resource
    AssetCheck["Asset Check"] -.-> Resource
    Resource -.-> DuckDB
```
:::

With the Dagster UI, you can now see that an asset check is associated with the `joined_data` asset.

TODO: Screenshot

Asset checks will run when an asset is materialized, but asset checks can also be executed manually in the UI:

1. Reload your Definitions.
2. Navigate to the Asset Details page for the `joined_data` asset.
3. Select the "Checks" tab.
4. Click the **Execute** button for `missing_dimension_check`.

## Summary

The structure of the `etl_tutorial` module has remained the same:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/tree/step-2.txt" />

But there are now data checks on the assets we have created to help ensure the quality of the data in our pipeline.
