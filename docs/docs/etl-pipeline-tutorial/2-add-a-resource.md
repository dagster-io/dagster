We've now created our own assets and combined them with assets from a component. In this step, we will revisit the ingestion assets we defined, and include another Dagster object to assist with managing our database connection with DuckDB. Currently, each of our assets handles each connection separately, but this resource will allow us to centralize our connection to DuckDB into a single object so the connection can be shared across all our assets.

## 1. Define the DuckDB resource

In Dagster, [resources](/guides/build/external-resources) are reusable components that provide external context or functionality such as database connections, clients, or configurations. Resources can be used by a number of different Dagster objects, but we will first apply them to our assets.

First, we will need to install the `dagster-duckdb` library:

```bash
uv pip install dagster-duckdb pandas
```

Next, we need to scaffold our resources object with `dg`:

```bash
dg scaffold defs dagster.resources resources.py
```

This adds a file, `resources.py`, to the `etl_tutorial` module:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/tree/resources.txt" />

Within this file, we will define our resources using the <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="Definitions" decorator />.

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/src/etl_tutorial/defs/resources.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/etl_tutorial/defs/resources.py"
/>


```mermaid
%%{
  init: {
    'theme': 'base',
    'themeVariables': {
      'primaryColor': '#4F43DD',
      'primaryTextColor': '#FFFFFF',
      'primaryBorderColor': '#231F1B',
      'lineColor': '#DEDDFF',
      'secondaryColor': '#BDBAB7',
      'tertiaryColor': '#FFFFFF'
    }
  }
}%%
  graph LR
    style DuckDB fill:#BDBAB7,stroke:#BDBAB7,stroke-width:2px

    Asset -.-> Resource
    Resource -.-> DuckDB
```

## 2. Add a resource to our assets

With our resource defined, we need to update our asset code. Since all of our ingestion assets rely on the `import_url_to_duckdb` to execute the query, we will first update that function to use the `DuckDBResource` to handle query execution:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/src/etl_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_import_url_to_duckdb_with_resource"
  endBefore="end_import_url_to_duckdb_with_resource"
  title="src/etl_tutorial/defs/assets/py"
/>

The `DuckDBResource` is designed to handle concurrent queries, so we no longer need the `serialize_duckdb_query` function.

Now we can update the assets themselves. Each asset will now include a `DuckDBResource` input parameter set to `duckdb` (which is the key we set in `resources.py`):

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/src/etl_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_ingest_assets_2"
  endBefore="end_ingest_assets_2"
  title="src/etl_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
/>

The `DuckDBResource` connection will then be passed to the `import_url_to_duckdb` responsible for running the query.

Back in the UI, your assets will not appear any different, but you can view the resource in the **Definitions** tab:

1. Click **Deployment**, then click "etl-tutorial" to see your deployment.
2. Click **Definitions**.
3. Navigate to the "Resources" section to view all of your resources and select "duckdb".

You can see that this resource has three uses that line up with our three assets:

## Summary

We have now introduced resources for our project. The `etl_tutorial` module should look like this:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/etl_tutorial/tree/step-2.txt" />

Resources are very helpful as projects grow more complex, as they help ensure that all assets are using the same connection details and reduce the amount of custom code that needs to be written. We will also see that resources can be used by other Dagster objects.

## Next steps

In the next step, we will [ensure data quality with asset checks](/etl-pipeline-tutorial/data-quality).
