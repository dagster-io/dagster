The assets you created in the previous step represent pointers to files in the cloud. This is a good first step in building out the asset graph, but it would be better if they represented tables in our database.

In this step, you will load that data into [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org), an analytical database, so your assets will instead be representations of DuckDB tables.

Since the same database will be used across all three assets, rather than adding the connection logic to each asset, you can use a [resource](/guides/build/external-resources) to centralize the connection in a single object that can be shared across multiple Dagster objects.

Resources are Dagster objects much like assets, but they are not executed. Some Dagster entities in the `Definitions` layer complement other objects without being able to be directly executed. Typically, resources are reusable objects that supply external context, such as database connections, API clients, or configuration settings. Because of this, a single resource can be shared across many different Dagster objects.

## 1. Define the DuckDB resource

First, install the `dagster-duckdb` library:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
   <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

         ```shell
         uv add dagster-duckdb
         ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

         ```shell
         pip install dagster-duckdb
         ```

   </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Next, scaffold a resources file:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/dagster-tutorial/commands/dg-scaffold-resources.txt" />

This adds a generic resources file to your project. The `resources.py` file is now part of the `dagster-tutorial` module:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/dagster-tutorial/tree/resources.txt" />

Within this file, you can define a `DuckDBResource` that consolidates the database connection in one place, along with a `resources` function decorated with the <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="definitions" decorator /> decorator. This function maps all resources to specific keys that can be used throughout the project:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/dagster-tutorial/src/dagster_tutorial/defs/resources.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/dagster_tutorial/defs/resources.py"
/>

Here, the `duckdb` key is set to the `DuckDBResource` defined above. Any Dagster object that uses this resource key will use the underlying DuckDB connection.

## 2. Add the resource to the assets

With the resource defined, you can update the asset code. First, set the `DuckDBResource` as a parameter in each asset, using the name `duckdb`. This matches the key that was set when defining the resource, and allows it to be used inside the asset. Then, use the `get_connection` method from the resource to connect to the database and execute the query to create the tables:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/dagster-tutorial/src/dagster_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_define_assets_with_resources"
  endBefore="end_define_assets_with_resources"
  title="src/dagster_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
/>

## 3. Check definitions

Run `dg check` again to confirm that the assets and resources are configured correctly. If there is a mismatch between the key set in the resource and the key required by the asset, `dg check` will fail.

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/dagster-tutorial/commands/dg-check-defs.txt" />

## 4. View the resource

Back in the UI, your assets will not look different, but you can view the resource in the **Definitions** tab:

1. Click **Deployment**, then click "dagster-tutorial" to see your deployment.
2. Click **Definitions**.
3. Navigate to the "Resources" section to view all of your resources, then select "duckdb":

4. Click on "Uses" for the resource to see the three assets that depend on the resource:
