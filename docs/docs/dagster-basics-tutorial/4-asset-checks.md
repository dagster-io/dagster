When building data applications, it is important to ensure the quality of all underlying entities. In this step, you will add checks to confirm that your assets are producing the expected data.

In Dagster, these quality measures are called [asset checks](/guides/test/asset-checks) and are defined in a similar way to assets. When an asset is materialized, asset checks also execute and verify that certain criteria are met based on the logic within the check.

## 1. Define an asset check

To create an asset check, define a function and decorate it with the <PyObject section="asset-checks" module="dagster" object="asset_check" decorator /> decorator. Within the asset check, set the `asset` parameter to indicate which asset the check runs against.

The code below creates an asset check for the `orders_aggregation` asset to ensure that there are rows in the underlying DuckDB table:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/tutorials/dagster-tutorial/src/dagster_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_define_asset_checks"
  endBefore="end_define_asset_checks"
  title="src/dagster_tutorial/defs/assets.py"
/>

This asset check queries the table directly to determine if the data is valid. Based on the query result, it sets the <PyObject section="asset-checks" module="dagster" object="AssetCheckResult" /> to `True` or `False`.

The asset check uses the same `DuckDBResource` resource defined for the assets. Resources can be shared across all objects in Dagster.

## 2. Verify that the asset check runs

In the Dagster UI at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000), you should now see an asset check associated with the `orders_aggregation` asset:

Asset checks run automatically when an asset is materialized, but you can also execute them manually in the UI:

1. Navigate to **Assets**.
2. Click **Reload definitions**.
3. Navigate to the **Asset Details** page for the `orders_aggregation` asset.
4. Select the **Checks** tab.
5. Click **Execute** for `orders_aggregation`.
