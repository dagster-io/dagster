# Build your first Dagster pipeline

In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to build a Dagster pipeline—from initializing a new project to adding Dagster objects, and finally viewing and materializing your pipeline.

Each concept builds on the previous one, so by the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of Dagster’s core features and how they work together to create robust data workflows.

If you’d like to dive deeper into specific Dagster features and how they interact, check out our [Concepts page](/getting-started/concepts).

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this tutorial, you'll need:

- Python 3.9+ and a Python package manager. For more information, see the [Installation guide](/getting-started/installation).
- Familiarity with Python and SQL.
- A basic understanding of data pipelines.

You are now ready to starting building with Dagster.
