## About SharePoint

Microsoft SharePoint is a web-based collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office. It's primarily used as a document management and storage system, but its highly configurable nature allows it to be used to manage intranets, extranets, websites, document & file management, collaboration spaces, and business intelligence tools.
