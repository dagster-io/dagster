title: Dagster & Databricks
sidebar_label: Databricks
description: The Databricks integration library provides the `PipesDatabricksClient` resource, enabling you to launch Databricks jobs directly from Dagster assets and ops. This integration allows you to pass parameters to Databricks code while Dagster receives real-time events, such as logs, asset checks, and asset materializations, from the initiated jobs. With minimal code changes required on the job side, this integration is both efficient and easy to implement.

## Installation

<PackageInstallInstructions packageName="dagster-databricks" />

## All-Purpose Compute Example

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/integrations/databricks/dagster_code.py" language="python" />

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/integrations/databricks/databricks_code.py" language="python" />

## Serverless Compute Example
Using pipes with Serverless Compute is slightly different. First, you can't specify library dependencies, you must instead define dagster-pipes as a dependency in the notebook environoment.

Second, we use Volumes for context loading and messaging writing because dbfs is unreliable for Serverless Compute.
