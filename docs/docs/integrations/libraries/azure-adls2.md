## About Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS2)

**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 (ADLS2)** is a set of capabilities dedicated to big data analytics, built on Azure Blob Storage. ADLS2 combines the scalability, cost-effectiveness, security, and rich capabilities of Azure Blob Storage with a high-performance file system that's built for analytics and is compatible with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). This makes it an ideal choice for data lakes and big data analytics.
