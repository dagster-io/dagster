<Deprecated />

This library provides an integration with _[GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps)_ by providing a thin wrapper on the GitHub v4 GraphQL API. This allows for automating operations within your GitHub repositories and with the tighter permissions scopes that GitHub Apps allow for vs using a personal token.

### Installation

```bash
pip install dagster-github
```

### Example

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/integrations/github.py" language="python" />
