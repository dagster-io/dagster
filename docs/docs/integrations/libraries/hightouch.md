With this integration you can trigger Hightouch syncs and monitor them from within Dagster. Fine-tune when Hightouch syncs kick-off, visualize their dependencies, and monitor the steps in your data activation workflow.

This native integration helps your team more effectively orchestrate the last mile of data analyticsâ€”bringing that data from the warehouse back into the SaaS tools your business teams live in. With the `dagster-hightouch` integration, Hightouch users have more granular and sophisticated control over when data gets activated.

pip install dagster-hightouch
