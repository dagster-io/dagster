### About Prometheus

**Prometheus** is an open source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Originally built at SoundCloud, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in 2016 as the second hosted project, after Kubernetes.

Prometheus collects and stores metrics as time series data along with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.
