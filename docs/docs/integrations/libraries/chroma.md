### About Chroma

**Chroma** is the open-source AI application database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs. It provides a simple API for storing and querying embeddings, documents, and metadata. Chroma can be used to build semantic search, question answering, and other AI-powered applications. The database can run embedded in your application or as a separate service.
