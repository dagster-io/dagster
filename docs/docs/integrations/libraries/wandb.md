Use Dagster and Weights & Biases (W&B) to orchestrate your MLOps pipelines and maintain ML assets. The integration with W&B makes it easy within Dagster to:

- use and create W&B Artifacts
- use and create Registered Models in W&B Model Registry
- run training jobs on dedicated compute using W&B Launch
- use the Weights & Biases client in ops and assets

The W&B Dagster integration provides a W&B-specific Dagster resource and I/O Manager:

- `wandb_resource`: a Dagster resource used to authenticate and communicate to the W&B API.
- `wandb_artifacts_io_manager`: a Dagster I/O Manager used to consume W&B Artifacts.

### Installation

To use this integration you will need a Weights and Biases account. Then you will need a W&B API Key, a W&B entity (user or team), and a W&B project. Full installation details can be found on [the Weights and Biases website here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/dagster).

**Note** that Weights & Biases do offer a free cloud account for personal (non-corporate) use. Check out their [pricing page](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing) for details.

### Example
