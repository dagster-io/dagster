## About dbt Cloud

**dbt Cloud** is a hosted service for running dbt jobs. It helps data analysts and engineers productionize dbt deployments. Beyond dbt open source, dbt Cloud provides scheduling , CI/CD, serving documentation, and monitoring & alerting.

If you're currently using dbt Cloudâ„¢, you can also use Dagster to run `dbt-core` in its place. You can read more about [how to do that here](https://dagster.io/blog/migrate-off-dbt-cloud).
