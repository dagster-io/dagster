Importing an existing dbt project in Dagster+ allows you to automatically load your dbt models as Dagster assets. This can be be done with:

- An existing dbt project that is not already using Dagster, or
- A Dagster project in which your dbt project is included

:::tip

To create a Dagster project with an integrated dbt project, see "[Creating a dbt project in a Dagster project](/integrations/libraries/dbt/creating-a-dbt-project-in-dagster)".
