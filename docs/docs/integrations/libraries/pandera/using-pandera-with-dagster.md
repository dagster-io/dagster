# Pandera & Dagster

import Beta from '../../../partials/\_Beta.md';

<Beta />

The `dagster-pandera` integration library provides an API for generating [Dagster Types](/api/python-api/types) from [Pandera](https://github.com/pandera-dev/pandera) dataframe schemas. Like all Dagster types, `dagster-pandera`-generated types can be used to annotate [op](/guides/build/ops) inputs and outputs.

Using Pandera with Dagster allows you to:

- Visualize the shape of the data by displaying dataframe structure information in the Dagster UI
- Implement runtime type-checking with rich error reporting

## Limitations

Currently, `dagster-pandera` only supports pandas and Polars dataframes, despite Pandera supporting validation on other dataframe backends.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need:

- [To install](/getting-started/installation) the `dagster` and `dagster-pandera` Python packages:

  ```bash
  pip install dagster dagster-pandera
  ```

- Familiarity with [Dagster Types](/api/python-api/types

## Usage

The `dagster-pandera` library exposes only a single public function, `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type`, which generates Dagster types from Pandera schemas. The Dagster type wraps the Pandera schema and invokes the schema's `validate()` method inside its type check function.

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/integrations/pandera/example.py" />

In the above example, we defined a toy job (`stocks_job`) with a single asset, `apple_stock_prices_dirty`. This asset returns a pandas `DataFrame` containing the opening and closing prices of Apple stock (AAPL) for a random week. The `_dirty` suffix is included because we've corrupted the data with a few random nulls.

Let's look at this job in the UI:

Notice that information from the `StockPrices` Pandera schema is rendered in the asset detail area of the right sidebar. This is possible because `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type` extracts this information from the Pandera schema and attaches it to the returned Dagster type.

If we try to run `stocks_job`, our run will fail. This is expected, as our (dirty) data contains nulls and Pandera columns are non-nullable by default. The [Dagster Typ](/api/python-api/types) returned by `pandera_schema_to_dagster_type` contains a type check function that calls `StockPrices.validate()`. This is invoked automatically on the return value of `apple_stock_prices_dirty`, leading to a type check failure.

Notice the `STEP_OUTPUT` event in the following screenshot to see Pandera's full output:
