The [`dagster-fivetran` library](/api/libraries/dagster-fivetran) provides a `FivetranAccountComponent` which can be used to easily represent Fivetran connectors as assets in Dagster.

## 1. Prepare a Dagster project

To begin, you'll need a Dagster project. You can use an [existing components-ready project](/guides/build/projects/moving-to-components/migrating-project) or create a new one:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/1-scaffold-project.txt" />

Activate the project virtual environment:

```
source ../.venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, add the `dagster-fivetran` library to the project:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/2-add-fivetran.txt" />

## 2. Scaffold a Fivetran component

Now that you have a Dagster project, you can scaffold a Fivetran component. You'll need to provide your Fivetran account ID and API credentials, which you can set as environment variables on the command line:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/3-scaffold-fivetran-component.txt" />

The scaffold call will generate a `defs.yaml` file:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/4-tree.txt" />

### YAML configuration

In its scaffolded form, the `defs.yaml` file contains the configuration for your Fivetran workspace:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/5-component.yaml"
  title="my_project/defs/fivetran_ingest/defs.yaml"
  language="yaml"
/>

## 3. Check the component configuration

You can check the configuration of your component with `dg list defs`:

<WideContent maxSize={1100}>
  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/6-list-defs.txt" />
</WideContent>

## 4. Select specific connectors

You can select specific Fivetran connectors to include in your component using the `connector_selector` key. This allows you to filter which connectors are represented as assets:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/7-customized-component.yaml"
  title="my_project/defs/fivetran_ingest/defs.yaml"
  language="yaml"
/>

<WideContent maxSize={1100}>
  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/8-list-defs.txt" />
</WideContent>

## 5. Customize Fivetran assets

Properties of the assets emitted by each connector can be customized in the `defs.yaml` file using the `translation` key:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/9-customized-component.yaml"
  title="my_project/defs/fivetran_ingest/defs.yaml"
  language="yaml"
/>

<WideContent maxSize={1100}>
  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/integrations/fivetran-component/10-list-defs.txt" />
</WideContent>
