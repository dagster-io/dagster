We recommend periodically (every 6 months or so) updating the version of the Dagster GitHub Actions in your workflow files. These actions use version tags that follow the Dagster release convention (e.g., `@v1.11.13`). You can find the most [recent Dagster release](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/releases) on GitHub.
