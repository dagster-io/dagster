# Fine-tune an LLM

In this example, you'll build a pipeline with Dagster that:

- Loads a public Goodreads JSON dataset into DuckDB
- Performs feature engineering to enhance the data
- Creates and validates the data files needed for an OpenAI fine-tuning job
- Generate a custom model and validate it

  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- Basic Python knowledge
- Python 3.9+ installed on your system. Refer to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/installation) for information.
- Familiarity with SQL and Python data manipulation libraries, such as [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
- Understanding of data pipelines and the extract, transform, and load process (ETL).

## Step 1: Set up your Dagster environment

First, set up a new Dagster project.

1. Clone the [Dagster repo](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) and navigate to the project:

   ```bash
   cd examples/docs_projects/project-llm-fine-tune
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
   ```bash
   uv venv dagster_example
   source dagster_example/bin/activate
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
   ```bash
   uv venv dagster_example
   dagster_example\Scripts\activate
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. Install Dagster and the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Step 2: Launch the Dagster webserver

To make sure Dagster and its dependencies were installed correctly, navigate to the project root directory and start the Dagster webserver:

followed by a bash code snippet for 

```bash
dagster dev
```
