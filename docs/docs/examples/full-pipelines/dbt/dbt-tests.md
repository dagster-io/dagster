You may have noticed that while configuring our dbt assets, we didn’t define anything related to tests. And yet, our dbt project includes them—specifically for the `stg_zones` model:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_projects/project_dbt/src/project_dbt/analytics/models/staging/staging.yml"
  language="yaml"
  title="src/project_dbt/analytics/models/staging/staging.yml"
/>

The good news: no extra configuration is required to include these tests in Dagster. When Dagster parses the dbt project, it automatically:

- Detects any dbt tests declared in the project.
- Converts them into [asset checks](/guides/test/asset-checks) linked to the Dagster asset that represents the model.

For example, the `stg_zones` model defines two tests in its YAML file. Dagster registers these as two separate asset checks on the `stg_zones` asset.

In the UI, you can see the two asset checks tied to the model. When the asset runs, its underlying dbt tests execute as well, and their results are recorded:

Once your dbt project is integrated this way, the Asset Catalog in Dagster shows both lineage and quality signals:

- Materialization history (successful or failed runs).
- A complete history of associated tests, showing which checks passed or failed over time.

This unified view helps you monitor both **data freshness** and **data quality**, catching regressions or upstream issues early.
