In this tutorial, you'll build a pipeline with Dagster that:

- Automatically detects newly published podcasts
- Transcribes them using the power of GPUs
- Notifies you with a summary

<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- Basic Python knowledge
- Python 3.9+ installed on your system. For more information, see the [Installation guide](/getting-started/installation).
</details>


## Step 1: Set up your Dagster environment

First, set up a new Dagster project.

1. Clone the [Dagster repo](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster) and navigate to the project:

   ```bash
   cd examples/project_dagster_modal_pipes
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
   ```bash
   uv venv dagster_tutorial
   source dagster_tutorial/bin/activate
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
   ```bash
   uv venv dagster_tutorial
   dagster_tutorial\Scripts\activate
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

3. Install Dagster and the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Step 2: Launch the Dagster webserver

To make sure Dagster and its dependencies were installed correctly, navigate to the project root directory and start the Dagster webserver:


```bash
dagster dev
```
