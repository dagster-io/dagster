In Dagster+, there are two types of deployments:

- [**Branch deployments**](/dagster-plus/features/ci-cd/branch-deployments), which are temporary deployments built for testing purposes.
- **Full deployments**, which are persistent, fully-featured deployments intended to perform actions on a recurring basis.

This section focuses on **full deployments**, hereafter referred to as "deployments".
