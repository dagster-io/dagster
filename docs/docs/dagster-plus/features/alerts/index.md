Dagster+ alerts can notify you of events occurring in your deployment so you can catch potential issues early, saving you debugging time and money.

To create a Dagster+ alert, you must [configure an alert notification service](configuring-an-alert-notification-service), then [create an alert policy](creating-alerts) to define the conditions that will trigger an alert and the notification service that will be used to send it.
