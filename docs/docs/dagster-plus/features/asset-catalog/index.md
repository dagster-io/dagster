- View all assets in your Dagster deployment
- View details about a specific asset by clicking on it
- Search assets by asset key, compute kind, asset group, code location, tags, owners, and more
- Access the global asset lineage
- Reload definitions

To access the asset catalog, click **Catalog** in the top navigation.
