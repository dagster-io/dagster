## Prerequisites

To use SCIM provisioning, you'll need:

- A Dagster+ Pro plan
- [An IdP for which Dagster+ supports SSO and SCIM provisioning](#supported-identity-providers)
- Permissions in your IdP that allow you to configure SSO and SCIM provisioning

## Supported Identity Providers

Dagster+ currently supports SCIM provisioning for the following Identity Providers (IdP):

- [Okta](/dagster-plus/features/authentication-and-access-control/scim/okta-scim)
- [Microsoft Azure AD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/dagster-cloud-provisioning-tutorial)

Use the setup guide for your IdP to get started.
