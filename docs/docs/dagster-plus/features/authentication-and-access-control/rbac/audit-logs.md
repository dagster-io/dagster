The Dagster+ audit log enables Dagster+ Pro organizations to track and attribute changes to their Dagster deployment.

For large organizations, tracking down when and by whom changes were made can be crucial for maintaining security and compliance. The audit log is also valuable
 for tracking operational history, including sensor and schedule updates.

This guide walks through how to access the audit log and details the interactions which are tracked in the audit log.

## Programmatic access to audit logs

Audit logs can be accessed programmatically over the Dagster+ GraphQL API. You can access a visual GraphiQL interface
by navigating to `https://<org>.dagster.cloud/<deployment>/graphql` in your browser. You can also query the API directly using the Python client.
