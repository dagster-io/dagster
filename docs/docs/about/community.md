# Community

No ecosystem is more heterogeneous than data processing. We enthusiastically welcome community contributions to code and to docs, issue, and bug reports on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster/), and questions, feature requests, and discussion in our [Slack](https://dagster.io/slack).

We're committed to making the Dagster project inclusive and welcoming. Working on this project should feel friendly, collegial, and relaxed for everyone.

## Open source commitment

:::

Dagster itself, defined as the code and intellectual property in the [Dagster public repository](https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster/), will forever and always be free. The Dagster core team also builds and operates the commercial product [Dagster+](https://dagster.io/plus) as a distinct and well-defined layer on top of Dagster. We believe that this structure will be the most sustainable for serving our users as the Dagster team and product grows.

## Code of conduct

### Our pledge

As members, contributors, and core team members, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible, or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility, apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what's best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Slack content guidelines

The Dagster core team will do its best to respond to every message but can't guarantee a response to everyone. Don't treat the community as your own personal customer support service.

Community members are expected to follow the guidelines for discussion in the Dagster community. Make an effort to contribute quality content so that our community can spend more time hanging out and talking about issues rather than cleaning and filtering our communication channels.

- Start discussions in the [right channels](https://app.slack.com/client/TCDGQDUKF/browse-channels)
- Craft questions with sufficient detail to reproduce issues or address any concerns
- Use threads for discussions
- Create new discussions, rather than diverting discussions to new directions midstream
- Don't demand attention by cross-posting discussions, sending messages outside threads to bump conversations, or explicitly mentioning `@channel`, `@here`, or community members
- Don't solicit community members about your products and services

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting on an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

### Enforcement

#### Responsibilities

The Dagster core team is responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. For the full list of core team members, refer to [the Dagster Labs team page](https://dagster.io/about).

The Dagster core team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that aren't aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

#### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Dagster core team responsible for enforcement at [conduct@dagsterlabs.com](mailto:conduct@dagsterlabs.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The Dagster core team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

#### Guidelines

The Dagster core team will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

| Level | Community impact | Consequence |
|---|----|----|
| Reminder | Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. | A private, written reminder from the Dagster core team, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. |
| Warning | A violation through a single incident or series of actions. | A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces and external channels like social media. Violating these terms will lead to a permanent ban. |
| Permanent ban | Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. | A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. |
