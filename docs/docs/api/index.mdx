These docs cover the entire public surface of all Dagster CLIs, the core dagster SDK, REST APIs, the GraphQL API, and SDKs for public integration libraries.

Dagster follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). We attempt to isolate breaking changes to the public APIs to minor versions on a roughly 12-week cadence, and will announce deprecations in Slack and in the release notes to patch versions on a roughly weekly cadence.
