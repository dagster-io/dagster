title: API reference
---

These docs aim to cover the entire public surface of the core dagster APIs, as well as public APIs from all provided libraries.

Dagster follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We attempt to isolate breaking changes to the public APIs to minor versions on a roughly 12-week cadence, and will announce deprecations in Slack and in the release notes to patch versions on a roughly weekly cadence.
