title: API reference
---

These docs aim to cover the entire public surface of the core dagster APIs, as well as public APIs from all provided libraries.

Dagster follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We attempt to isolate breaking changes to the public APIs to minor versions on a roughly 12-week cadence, and will announce deprecations in Slack and in the release notes to patch versions on a roughly weekly cadence.

## AssetSpec

The `AssetSpec` class now includes an optional `kinds_order` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify the order of kinds for assets. If `kinds_order` is provided, the `kinds` property will return kinds in the specified order.

### Example

```python
from dagster import AssetSpec

asset_spec = AssetSpec(
    key="my_asset",
    kinds={"python", "bigquery", "gcs"},
    kinds_order=["python", "bigquery", "gcs"]
)
```

## AssetOut

The `AssetOut` class now includes an optional `kinds_order` parameter. This parameter allows you to specify the order of kinds for assets. If `kinds_order` is provided, the `kinds` property will return kinds in the specified order.

### Example

```python
from dagster import AssetOut

asset_out = AssetOut(
    key="my_asset",
    kinds={"python", "bigquery", "gcs"},
    kinds_order=["python", "bigquery", "gcs"]
)
```
