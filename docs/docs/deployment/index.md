description: Deploying Dagster OSS, Dagster+ Hybrid, and Dagster+ Serverless.
---

You can deploy Dagster with Dagster+ or Dagster open source (OSS).

## Dagster+

[Dagster+](/deployment/dagster-plus) is a managed orchestration platform built on top of Dagster's open source engine. It is the most performant, reliable, and cost effective way for data engineering teams to run Dagster in production. Dagster+ is also great for students, researchers, or individuals who want to explore Dagster with minimal overhead.

Dagster+ comes in two flavors: a fully [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) offering and a [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) offering. 

## OSS

[Dagster OSS](/deployment/oss) is an open source orchestration platform that you deploy and manage yourself. It is a good fit for local development and for those who are comfortable with self-managed infrastructure.
