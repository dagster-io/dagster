When you import a project into Dagster+ from GitHub or Gitlab, a few `.yml` files will be added to the repository. These files are essential as they manage the deployments in Dagster+.

## branch_deployments.yml

This file defines the steps required to use [branch deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/ci-cd/branch-deployments). It is required for branch deployments.

:::note

If you are using a [Hybrid deployment](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid), you must manually add `branch_deployments.yml` to the repository.

:::

## deploy.yml

This file is required for Dagster+. It defines the steps required to deploy a project in Dagster+, including running checks, checking out the project directory, and deploying the project. Additionally, note the following:

- **If you are using a [Hybrid deployment](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid)**, you must manually add `deploy.yml` to the repository.
- **If you are using [dbt](/integrations/libraries/dbt)**, you may need to take additional steps to deploy your project. For more information, see "[Using dbt with Dagster+](/integrations/libraries/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster-plus).
