In this guide, we'll walk you through configuring [Microsoft Entra ID provisioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/sync-scim) for Dagster+.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **To have set up Entra ID SSO for Dagster+.** For more information, see the [Entra ID setup guide](//dagster-plus/features/authentication-and-access-control/sso/azure-ad-sso).
- **Permissions in Entra ID that allow you to configure SSO and SCIM provisioning.**
- **The following in Dagster+:**
  - A Pro plan
  - [Organization Admin permissions](/deployment/dagster-plus/authentication-and-access-control/rbac/user-roles-permissions) in your organization

## Steps

Follow the steps in the [Microsoft Dagster Cloud provisioning tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/saas-apps/dagster-cloud-provisioning-tutorial).

Once Entra ID successfully syncs users to Dagster+, synced users will have a 'synced' icon next to them in the Dagster+ users page:

User groups synced from Entra ID will appear on the Dagster+ teams page:
