title: About Dagster+
---

Dagster+ is a managed orchestration platform built on top of Dagster's open source engine.

Dagster+ is built to be the most performant, reliable, and cost effective way for data engineering teams to run Dagster in production. Dagster+ is also great for students, researchers, or individuals who want to explore Dagster with minimal overhead.

Dagster+ comes in two flavors: a fully [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) offering and a [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) offering. In both cases, Dagster+ does the hard work of managing your data orchestration control plane. Compared to a [Dagster open source deployment](/deployment/oss), Dagster+ manages:

- Dagster's web UI at https://dagster.plus
- Metadata stores for data cataloging and cost insights
- Backend services for orchestration, alerting, and more

Dagster+ Serverless is fully managed and your Dagster code executes in our environment. In Dagster+ Hybrid, you run an execution environment that connects to the Dagster+ control plane.

In addition to managed infrastructure, Dagster+ also adds core capabilities on top of Dagster open source to enable teams building data platforms:

- [Insights](/guides/monitor/insights), a powerful tool for identifying trends in your data platform overtime, optimizing cost, and answering questions like "Why does it feel like our pipelines are taking longer this month?".
- [Alerts]/guides/monitor/alerts) to a variety of services like Slack, PagerDuty, and email to notify your team of failed runs, data quality issues, and violated SLAs.
- Authentication, [Role Based Access Control](/deployment/dagster-plus/authentication-and-access-control/rbac), and [Audit Logs](/deployment/dagster-plus/authentication-and-access-control/rbac/audit-logs) which help teams implement data mesh strategies while remaining compliant.
- [Asset Catalog](/guides/build/assets/asset-catalog/), a powerful search-first experience that builds off of Dagster's best-in-class lineage graph to include searching for assets, metadata, column lineage, and more.
- [Branch Deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/ci-cd/branch-deployments/index.md)
