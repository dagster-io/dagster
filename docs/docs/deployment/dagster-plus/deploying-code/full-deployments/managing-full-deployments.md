Full deployments are independent deployment instances with separately managed permissions within your Dagster deployment.

When a Dagster+ organization is created, a single deployment named `prod` will also be created. To create additional full deployments, you must sign up for a [Pro plan](https://dagster.io/pricing).

Each full deployment can have one or multiple [code locations](/deployment/code-locations).

:::note Full deployments vs branch deployments

In Dagster+, there are two types of deployments:

- [**Branch deployments**](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/branch-deployments), which are temporary deployments built for testing purposes. We recommend using branch deployments to test your changes, even if you're able to create additional deployments. Branch deployments are available for all Dagster+ users, regardless of plan.
- **Full deployments**, which are persistent, fully-featured deployments intended to perform actions on a recurring basis. This guide focuses on full deployments.

:::

## Viewing and switching full deployments

In Dagster+, you can view and switch between full deployments using the **deployment switcher**. To view all deployments, click **View all deployments**.

## Creating full deployments

:::note Prerequisites

To create full deployments, you need a [Pro plan](https://dagster.io/pricing) and [Organization Admin permissions](/deployment/dagster-plus/authentication-and-access-control/rbac/user-roles-permissions).

:::

To create a full deployment:

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.
2. Access the **Deployments** page using one of the following options:
   - Click the **deployment switcher > View all deployments**.
   - Click **your user icon > Organization Settings > Deployments**.
3. Click the **+ New deployment** button.
4. In the new deployment modal, enter the following:
   - **Name** - Enter a name for the full deployment.
   - **Initial deployment permissions** - Select the permissions you want to use to create the full deployment:
     - **Empty permissions** - Creates the full deployment with an empty set of permissions. **Note**: Only Organization Admins will be able to manage the full deployment until other uses are granted Admin or Editor permissions.
     - **Copy from** - Creates the full deployment using permissions duplicated from an existing full deployment.
5. When finished, click **Create deployment**.

## Deleting full deployments

:::note

[Organization Admin permissions](/deployment/dagster-plus/authentication-and-access-control/rbac/user-roles-permissions) are required to delete deployments. Additionally, note that deleting a deployment also deletes all its associated data, including code locations, jobs, schedules, and sensors.

:::

To delete a full deployment:

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.
2. Access the **Deployments** page using one of the following options:
   - Click the **deployment switcher > View all deployments**.
   - Click the **deployment switcher**, then the **gear icon** next to the full deployment.
   - Click **your user icon > Organization Settings > Deployments**.
3. Click the **Delete** button next to the full deployment you want to delete.
4. When prompted, confirm the deletion.

## Configuring full deployment settings

:::note

[Editor permissions](/deployment/dagster-plus/authentication-and-access-control/rbac/user-roles-permissions) are required to modify full deployment settings.

:::

Full deployment settings can be configured in the Dagster+ interface or using the `dagster-cloud` CLI. For more information about individual settings, see the [full deployment settings reference](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/full-deployments/full-deployment-settings-reference).

  </TabItem>
<TabItem value="dagster-cloud CLI">

:::note

`dagster-cloud` 0.13.14 or later must be installed to run the CLI. Agent and/or job code doesn't need to be upgraded.

:::

Create a file with the settings you'd like to configure. For example:

```yaml
# my-settings.yaml

concurrency:
  pools:
    granularity: 'run'
    default_limit: 1
  runs:
    max_concurrent_runs: 10
    tag_concurrency_limits:
      - key: 'database'
        value: 'redshift'
        limit: 5

run_monitoring:
  start_timeout_seconds: 1200
  cancel_timeout_seconds: 1200

run_retries:
  max_retries: 0
```

Use the CLI to upload the settings file:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment settings set-from-file my-settings.yaml
```

This will replace all of your configured settings. Any that are not specified will resort to their default values. You can also use the CLI to read your current settings, including the default values:

```shell
dagster-cloud deployment settings get
```
