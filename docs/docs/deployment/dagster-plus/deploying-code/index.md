When deploying code to Dagster+, you can do the following:

- Create [full deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/full-deployments), which are persistent, fully featured deployments intended to run pipelines on a recurring basis (for example, persistent staging and dev environments).
- Set up [CI/CD](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/configuring-ci-cd) to continuously deploy code from a Git repository on push to the main branch.
- Set up [branch deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/branch-deployments), which create ephemeral preview deployments of your Dagster code in Git branches, right in Dagster+, every time you create a branch and open a pull or merge request.
