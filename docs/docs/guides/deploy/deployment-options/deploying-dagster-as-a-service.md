  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster project created
- Working knowledge of containerization and managing services

</details>

This guide will walk you through deploying Dagster as a service on a single machine. It includes instructions for setting up the Dagster webserver and daemon. This approach is suitable for small-scale deployments or for testing purposes. For production environments, consider using containerized deployments or cloud-based solutions

## Running the Dagster Webserver

The Dagster webserver is the core component of any Dagster deployment. It serves the Dagster UI and responds to GraphQL queries.

### Installation

First, install the Dagster webserver:

```bash
pip install dagster-webserver
```

### Starting the Dagster Webserver

Before starting the webserver, set the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable, which tells Dagster where to store its persistent data and logs.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="linux-mac" label="Linux/macOS (Bash)" default>

```bash
export DAGSTER_HOME="/home/yourusername/dagster_home"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows (PowerShell)" default>

```powershell
$env:DAGSTER_HOME = "C:\Users\YourUsername\dagster_home"
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

Then, to run the webserver, use the following command:

```bash
dagster-webserver -h 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

This configuration will:

- Set the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable, which tells Dagster where to store its persistent data and logs
- Write execution logs to `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs`
- Listen on `0.0.0.0:3000`

## Running the Dagster Daemon

The Dagster daemon is necessary if you're using schedules, sensors, backfills, or want to set limits on the number of runs that can be executed simultaneously.

### Installation

Install the Dagster daemon:

```bash
pip install dagster
```

### Starting the Daemon

Make sure you've set the `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable, see [Running the Dagster Webserver](#running-the-dagster-webserver) for instructions.
Then, run the Dagster daemon with this command:

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

The `dagster-daemon` process will periodically check your instance for:

- New runs to be launched from your run queue
- Runs triggered by your running schedules or sensors

:::tip
Ensure that the `dagster-daemon` process has access to:

- Your `dagster.yaml` file
- Your `workspace.yaml` file
- The components defined on your instance
- The repositories defined in your workspace
  :::

### Monitoring the Daemon

You can check the status of your `dagster-daemon` process in the Dagster UI:

1. Navigate to the Instance tab in the left-hand navigation bar
2. View the daemon status

:::important
A deployment can have multiple instances of `dagster-webserver`, but should include only a single `dagster-daemon` process.
