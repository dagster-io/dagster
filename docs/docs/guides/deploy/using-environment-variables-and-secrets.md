Environment variables, which are key-value pairs configured outside your source code, allow you to dynamically modify application behavior depending on environment.

Using environment variables, you can define various configuration options for your Dagster application and securely set up secrets. For example, instead of hard-coding database credentials - which is bad practice and cumbersome for development - you can use environment variables to supply user details. This allows you to parameterize your pipeline without modifying code or insecurely storing sensitive data.

## Declaring environment variables

How environment variables are declared depends on whether you're developing locally or have already deployed your Dagster project.

<TabItem value="Local development">

**Local development**

As of Dagster 1.1.0, using `.env` files is supported for loading environment variables into local environments. A `.env` file is a text file containing key-value pairs that is used locally, but not checked into source control. Using a `.env` file allows you to develop and test locally without putting sensitive info at risk. For example:

```shell
# .env

DATABASE_NAME=staging
DATABASE_SCHEMA=sales
DATABASE_USERNAME=salesteam
DATABASE_PASSWORD=supersecretstagingpassword
```

If Dagster detects a `.env` file in the same folder where `dagster-webserver` or `dagster-daemon` is launched, it will automatically load the environment variables in the file. This also applies to variables [exported from Dagster+](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/environment-variables/dagster-ui#export)


When using a `.env` file, keep the following in mind:

- The `.env` file must be in the same folder where `dagster-webserver` or `dagster-daemon` is launched
- Any time the `.env` file is modified, the workspace must be re-loaded to make the Dagster webserver/UI aware of the changes

<TabItem value="Dagster+">

**Dagster+**

Environment variables can be set a variety of ways in Dagster+:

- Directly in the UI
- Via agent configuration (Hybrid deployments only)

If using the UI, you can also [export locally-scoped variables to a `.env` file](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/environment-variables/dagster-ui#export), which you can then use to develop locally.

Refer to the [Dagster+ environment variables guide](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/environment-variables/) for more info.

How environment variables are set for Dagster projects deployed on your infrastructure depends on **where** Dagster is deployed. Refer to the deployment guide for your platform for more info:

* [Amazon Web Services EC2 / ECS](/guides/deploy/deployment-options/aws)
* [GCP](/guides/deploy/deployment-options/gcp)
* [Docker](/guides/deploy/deployment-options/docker)

## Accessing environment variables

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to access environment variables once they've been declared. There are two ways to do this:

- [In Python code](#in-python-code), which isn't specific to Dagster
- [From Dagster configuration](#from-dagster-configuration), which incorporates environment variables into the Dagster config system

### In Python code

To access environment variables in your Dagster code, you can use [`os.getenv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv):

```python
import os

database_name = os.getenv("DATABASE_NAME")
```

This approach also works for accessing [built-in environment variables for Dagster+](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/environment-variables/built-in):

```python
import os

deployment_name = os.getenv("DAGSTER_CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_NAME")
```

For a real-world example, see the [Dagster+ branch deployments example](#dagster-branch-deployments).

You can also call the `get_value()` method on the `EnvVar`:

```python
from dagster import EnvVar

database_name = EnvVar('DATABASE_NAME').get_value()
```

### From Dagster configuration

[Configurable Dagster objects](/guides/operate/configuration/run-configuration) - such as ops, assets, resources, I/O managers, and so on - can accept configuration from environment variables. Dagster provides a native way to specify environment variables in your configuration. These environment variables are retrieved at launch time, rather than on initialization as with `os.getenv`. Refer to the [next section](#using-envvar-vs-osgetenv) for more info.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="In Python code">

**In Python code**

To access an environment variable as part of a Dagster configuration in Python code, you may use the following special syntax:

```python
"PARAMETER_NAME": EnvVar("ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME")
```

For example:

```python
"access_token": EnvVar("GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

And when specifying an integer number:

```python
"database_port": EnvVar.int("DATABASE_PORT")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="In YAML or config dictionaries">

**In YAML or config dictionaries**

To access an environment variable as part of a Dagster configuration in YAML or in a config dictionary, use the following syntax:

```python
"PARAMETER_NAME": {"env": "ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME"}
```

For example:

```python
"access_token": {"env": "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN"}
```

Refer to the [Handling secrets section](#handling-secrets) and [Per-environment configuration example](#per-environment-configuration-example) for examples.

### Using EnvVar vs os.getenv

We just covered two different ways to access environment variables in Dagster. So, which one should you use? When choosing an approach, keep the following in mind:

- **When `os.getenv` is used**, the variable's value is retrieved when Dagster loads the [code location](/guides/deploy/code-locations/) and **will** be visible in the UI.
- **When `EnvVar` is used**, the variable's value is retrieved at runtime and **won't** be visible in the UI.

Using the `EnvVar` approach has a few unique benefits:

- **Improved observability.** The UI will display information about configuration values sourced from environment variables.
- **Secret values are hidden in the UI.** Secret values are hidden in the Launchpad, Resources page, and other places where configuration is displayed.
- **Simplified testing.** Because you can provide string values directly to configuration rather than environment variables, testing may be easier.

## Handling secrets

Using environment variables to provide secrets ensures sensitive info won't be visible in your code or the launchpad in the UI. In Dagster, best practice for handling secrets uses [configuration](/guides/operate/configuration/run-configuration) and [resources](/guides/build/external-resources/).

A resource is typically used to connect to an external service or system, such as a database. Resources can be configured separately from the rest of your app, allowing you to define it once and reuse it as needed.

Let's take a look at an example from the [Dagster Crash Course](https://dagster.io/blog/dagster-crash-course-oct-2022), which creates a GitHub resource and supplies it to assets. Let's start by looking at the resource:

```python
## resources.py

from dagster import StringSource, resource
from github import Github

class GithubClientResource(ConfigurableResource):
  access_token: str

  def get_client(self) -> Github:
    return Github(self.access_token)
```

Let's review what's happening here:

- This code creates a GitHub resource named `GithubClientResource`
- By subclassing <PyObject section="resources" module="dagster" object="ConfigurableResource" /> and specifying the `access_token` field, we're telling Dagster that we want to be able to configure the resource with an `access_token` parameter
- Since `access_token` is a string value, this config parameter can either be:
  - An environment variable, or
  - Provided directly in the configuration

As storing secrets in configuration is bad practice, we'll opt for using an environment variable. In this code, we're configuring the resource supplying it to our assets:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/using_environment_variables_and_secrets/repository.py" startAfter="start" endBefore="end" />

Let's review what's happening here:

- We pass configuration info to the resource when we construct it. In this example, we're telling Dagster to load the `access_token` from the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable by wrapping it in `EnvVar`.
- We're adding that resource to our <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="Definitions" /> object so it's available for our assets.

## Parameterizing pipeline behavior

Using environment variables, you define how your code should execute at runtime.

- [Per-environment configuration example](#per-environment-configuration-example)

### Per-environment configuration example

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to use different I/O manager configurations for `local` and `production` environments using [configuration](/guides/operate/configuration/run-configuration) (specifically the configured API) and [resources](/guides/build/external-resources/).

This example is adapted from the [Transitioning data pipelines from development to production guide](/guides/deploy/dev-to-prod):

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/using_environment_variables_and_secrets/repository_v2.py" startAfter="start_new" endBefore="end_new" />

Let's review what's happening here:

- We've created a dictionary of resource definitions, `resources`, named after our `local` and `production` environments. In this example, we're using a [Pandas Snowflake I/O manager](/api/python-api/libraries/dagster-snowflake-pandas).
- For both `local` and `production`, we constructed the I/O manager using environment-specific run configuration. Note the differences in configuration between `local` and `production`, specifically where environment variables were used.
- Following the `resources` dictionary, we define the `deployment_name` variable, which determines the current executing environment. This variable defaults to `local`, ensuring that `DAGSTER_DEPLOYMENT=PRODUCTION` must be set to use the `production` configuration.

### Dagster+ branch deployments

:::note

This section is only applicable to Dagster+.

:::

This example demonstrates how to determine the current deployment type at runtime - [branch deployment](/dagster-plus/features/ci-cd/branch-deployments/) or [full deployment](/dagster-plus/deployment/management/deployments/) - without using resources or configuration.

Let's look at a function that determines the current deployment using the `DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT` environment variable:

```python

def get_current_env():
  is_branch_depl = os.getenv("DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT") == "1"
  assert is_branch_depl != None  # env var must be set
  return "branch" if is_branch_depl else "prod"

```

This function checks the value of `DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT` and, if equal to `1`, returns a variable with the value of `branch`. This indicates that the current deployment is a branch deployment. Otherwise, the deployment is a full deployment and is_branch_depl will be returned with a value of prod.

Using this info, we can write code that executes differently when in a branch deployment or a full deployment.

## Troubleshooting
