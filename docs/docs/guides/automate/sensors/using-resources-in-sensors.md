Dagster's [resources](/guides/build/external-resources/) system can be used with sensors to make it easier to call out to external systems and to make components of a sensor easier to plug in for testing purposes.

To specify resource dependencies, annotate the resource as a parameter to the sensor's function. Resources are provided by attaching them to your <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="Definitions" /> call.

Here, a resource is provided which provides access to an external API. The same resource could be used in the job or assets that the sensor triggers.

{/* TODO add dedent=4 prop to CodeExample below when implemented */}
<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py" startAfter="start_new_resource_on_sensor" endBefore="end_new_resource_on_sensor" />

For more information on resources, refer to the [Resources documentation](/guides/build/external-resources). To see how to test schedules with resources, refer to the section on testing sensors with resources in "[Testing sensors](testing-sensors)".
