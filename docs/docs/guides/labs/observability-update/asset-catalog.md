In the asset catalog, you can now build dashboards scoped by tags, teams, owners, or asset groups, enabling you to focus on the assets that matter most.

To build a dashboard, create saved selections from Catalog search. For more information, see the [asset selection syntax documentation](/guides/build/assets/asset-selection-syntax/reference).
