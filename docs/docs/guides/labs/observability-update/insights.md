The Dagster+ Observability update includes the next-generation version of [Dagster+ Insights](/guides/monitor/insights) with the following improvements:

- [New insights views to help you understand trends](#insights-views)
- [New KPI dashboard to help you understand platform health](#kpi-dashboard)

## New insights views \{#insights-views}

New insights views help you understand trends in a selection of assets using the [new asset health metrics](#new-asset-health-metrics).

To access these views, either click **Insights** in the left sidebar, or navigate to a selection of assets in the Asset Catalog, then click **Insights** in the top navigation bar in the UI:

Key asset health metrics, like materialization and failure count, are prominently displayed. To scope the view to a specific set of assets, type an [asset selection](/guides/build/assets/asset-selection-syntax/reference) in the search bar. Or, to view specific events in a time slice, click a datapoint in the line chart.

The insights view also features activity charts that group events by hour to help you understand scheduling and automation behaviors:

Events now stream back to insights views in real time. Insights views show metrics bucketed by hour through the last 120 days.

## New KPI dashboard \{#kpi-dashboard}

The new KPI dashboard helps you understand platform health across saved asset selections. To access it, click **Insights** in the left sidebar, then navigate to the **Trends** tab:

KPIs allow you to understand your platform health at a high level, and compare metrics from different saved selections.

## New asset health metrics

Insights views will continue to display existing [built-in metrics](/guides/monitor/insights#built-in-metrics) alongside new asset health metrics:

| Metric                               | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Materialization success rate         | Percentage of successful executions.                            |
| Avg. time to resolution              | Duration an asset spent in a failed state before materializing. |
| Freshness pass rate                  | Percentage of time an asset was fresh.                          |
| Check success rate                   | Percentage of successful check executions.                      |
| Materialization failure count        | Number of times an asset failed to materialize.                 |
| Freshness warning and failure counts | Number of times an asset entered a degraded freshness state.    |

## Known limitations

Since this functionality is still under active development, there are a few limitations we aim to address in upcoming releases:

- Health statuses don’t yet take asset observations into account, only materializations
- Failure events and metrics based on them (time to resolution, materialization success rate, and materialization failure count) will not exist prior to the introduction of the new asset metrics
- Insights views do not currently show cost, Dagster credits, and metadata metrics
- The new pages are all asset-focused, and haven’t yet been implemented for jobs
