All assets now have a single health status, that combines the status of the most recent materialization, freshness, and asset checks. These statuses appear on the home page, throughout the asset catalog, and in the asset lineage view, and can be used to group and filter your assets.

## Asset health statuses

The overall health status for an asset becomes the most elevated status from among each of the health components.

- Health statuses will take asset observations into account (currently they only account for materializations).
- Alerts will be added for health status changes.
