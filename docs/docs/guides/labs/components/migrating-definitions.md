:::note
This guide covers migrating existing Python definitions to components. This guide presupposes a components-enabled project. See the [getting started guide](./) or [Making an existing code location components-compatible](./existing-code-location) guide for more information.

When adding components to an existing Dagster code location, it is often useful to restructure your definitions into component folders, making it easier to eventually migrate them entirely to using components.

## Example project

Let's walk through an example of how to migrate existing definitions to components, with a project that has the following structure:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/1-tree.txt"  />

At the top level, we load definitions from various modules:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/2-definitions-before.py" title="my_existing_project/definitions.py" />

Each of these modules contains a variety of Dagster definitions, including assets, jobs, and schedules.

Let's migrate the `elt` module to a component.

## Create a Definitions component

We'll start by creating a `Definitions` component for the `elt` module:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/3-scaffold.txt" />

This creates a new folder in `my_existing_project/components/elt-definitions`, with a `component.yaml` file. This component requires a `definitions_path` parameter, which points to a file that contains a `Definitions` object.

Let's begin by moving the `elt` module's contents to the new component folder:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/4-mv.txt" />

Next, let's create a new `definitions.py` file in the component folder, which will collect all of the `elt` module's definitions into a single `Definitions` object:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/5-elt-nested-definitions.py" title="my_existing_project/components/elt-definitions/definitions.py" />

Finally, we can update the `component.yaml` file to point to the new `definitions.py` file:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/6-component-yaml.txt" title="my_existing_project/components/elt-definitions/component.yaml" />

Now that our component is defined, we can update the root `definitions.py` file to no longer explicitly load the `elt` module's `Definitions`:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/7-definitions-after.py" title="my_existing_project/definitions.py" />

Now, our project structure looks like this:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/8-tree-after.txt" />

We can repeat the same process for our other modules.

## Fully migrated project

Once each of our definitions modules are migrated to components, our project is left with a standardized structure.

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/9-tree-after-all.txt" />

Our project root now only constructs Definitions from components:

<CodeExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/migrating-definitions/10-definitions-after-all.py" title="my_existing_project/definitions.py" />
