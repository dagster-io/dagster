Dagster Components is a new way to structure your Dagster projects. It provides:

- An intelligent project layout that supports everything from "Hello world" to the most advanced projects.
- A set of easy-to-use component types for common integrations.

For more advanced use cases, it provides:

- A class-based interface ([Component](/api/dagster/components)) for dynamically constructing Dagster definitions from arbitrary data (such as third-party integration configuration files).
- A toolkit for building YAML domain-specific languages (DSLs) for `Components`, allowing instances of components to be defined with little to no Python code.

## Installation

To use Dagster Components, you'll need to [install the `dg` command line tool](/guides/labs/dg/). `dg` allows you to quickly scaffold Dagster projects and populate them with components.
