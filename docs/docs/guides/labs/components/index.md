Welcome to Dagster Components.

Dagster Components is a new way to structure your Dagster projects. It aims to provide:

- An opinionated project layout that supports ongoing scaffolding from "Hello world" to the most advanced projects.
- A class-based interface (`Component`) for dynamically constructing Dagster definitions from arbitrary data (such as third-party integration configuration files).
- A toolkit for building YAML DSLs for `Components`, allowing instances of components to be defined with little to no Python code.
- A Dagster-provided set of component types that provide a simplified user experience for common integrations.

## Installation

To use the Components framework, you must install the `dg` command line tool, which lives in the published Python package `dagster-dg`. `dg` is designed to be globally installed and has no dependency on `dagster` itself. `dg` allows you to quickly scaffold Dagster code locations and populate them with components. 

### 1. Install uv

We will use the Python package manager [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to install a globally available `dg`:

<CliInvocationExample contents="brew install uv" />

### 2. Install the dg command line tool

Once you have installed `uv`, use it to install `dg`.

<CliInvocationExample contents="uv tool install dagster-dg" />

:::tip

`uv tool install` installs python packages from PyPI into isolated environments and exposes their executables on your shell path. This means the `dg` command should now be available. It will always execute in an isolated environment separate from any project environment.

:::

:::note

If you have a local clone of the `dagster` repo, you can install a local version of `dg` with `uv tool install -e $DAGSTER_GIT_REPO_DIR/python_modules/libraries/dagster-dg`. This will create an isolated environment for `dg` just like the standard `uv tool install`, but the environment will contain an editable installation of `dagster-dg`.
