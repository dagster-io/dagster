Welcome to Dagster Components.

Dagster Components is a new way to structure your Dagster projects. It aims to provide:

- An opinionated project layout that supports ongoing scaffolding from "Hello world" to the most advanced projects.
- A class-based interface (`Component`) for dynamically constructing Dagster definitions from arbitrary data (such as third-party integration configuration files).
- A toolkit for building YAML DSLs for `Components`, allowing instances of components to be defined with little to no Python code.
- A Dagster-provided set of component types that provide a simplified user experience for common integrations.

## Installation

To use Dagster Components, install `uv`, then install the `dg` command line tool. `dg` allows you to quickly scaffold Dagster projects and populate them with components. It is designed to be globally installed and has no dependency on `dagster` itself.

### Install `uv`

import InstallUv from '@site/docs/partials/\_InstallUv.md';

<InstallUv />

### Install the `dg` command line tool

import InstallDg from '@site/docs/partials/\_InstallDg.md';

<InstallDg />

## `dg` API reference

import DgReference from '@site/docs/partials/\_DgReference.md';
