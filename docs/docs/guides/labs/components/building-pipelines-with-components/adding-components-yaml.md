:::info

This feature is still in development and might change in patch releases. Itâ€™s not production-ready, and the documentation may also evolve. Stay tuned for updates.

:::

To add Components to your project, you can instantiate them from the command line, which will create a new directory inside your `components/` folder that contains a `component.yaml` file.

If you want to use Python to add Components to your project instead, see "[Adding Components to your project with Python](adding-components-python)

:::note Prerequisites

Before adding a Component with Python, you must either [create a project with Components](/guides/labs/components/building-pipelines-with-components/creating-a-code-location-with-components) or [migrate an existing code location to Components](/guides/labs/components/migrating-to-components/migrating-code-location).

## Finding a Component

You can view the available Component types in your environment by running the following command:

```bash
dg component-type list
```

This will display a list of all the Component types that are available in your project. If you'd like to see more information about a specific Component type, you can run:

```bash
dg component-type docs <component-name>
```

This will display a webpage containing documentation for the specified Component type.

## Instantiating a Component

Once you've decided on the Component type that you'd like to use, you can instantiate it by running:

```bash
dg component generate <component-type> <component-name>
```

This will create a new directory inside your `components/` folder that contains a `component.yaml` file. Some Component types may also generate additional files as needed.

## Configuration

### Basic configuration

The `component.yaml` is the primary configuration file for a component. It contains two top-level fields:

- `type`: The type of the Componentdefined in this directory
- `params`: A dictionary of parameters that are specific to this Component type. The schema for these params is defined by the `get_schema` method on the Componentclass.

To see a sample `component.yaml` file for your specific component, you can run:

```bash
dg component-type docs <component-name>
```

### Component templating

Each `component.yaml` file supports a rich templating syntax, powered by `jinja2`.

#### Templating environment variables

A common use case for templating is to avoid exposing environment variables (particularly secrets) in your yaml files. The Jinja scope for a `component.yaml` file contains an `env` function which can be used to insert environment variables into the template.

```yaml
component_type: my_snowflake_component

params:
    account: {{ env('SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT') }}
    password: {{ env('SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD') }}
```
