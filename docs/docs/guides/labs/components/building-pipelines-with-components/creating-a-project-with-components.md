:::info

This feature is still in development and might change in patch releases. Itâ€™s not production ready, and the documentation may also evolve. Stay tuned for updates.

:::

:::note Prerequisites

Before creating a project with components, you must follow the [steps to install `uv` and `dg`](/guides/labs/components/index.md#installation).

:::

After [installing dependencies](/guides/labs/components/index.md#installation), you can scaffold a components-ready project. In the example below, we scaffold a project called `jaffle-platform`:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/index/2-scaffold.txt"  />

This command builds a project and initializes a new Python virtual environment inside of it. When using `dg`'s default environment management behavior, you won't need to worry about activating this virtual environment yourself.

## Project structure

Running `dg scaffold project <project-name>` creates a fairly standard Python project structure:

<CliInvocationExample path="docs_beta_snippets/docs_beta_snippets/guides/components/index/3-tree.txt" />

The following files and directories are included:

- A Python package `jaffle_platform`-- the name is an underscored inflection of the
project root directory (`jaffle_platform`).
- An (empty) `jaffle_platform_tests` test package.
- A `uv.lock` file.
- A `pyproject.toml` file.

:::note

For more information about the sections and settings in pyproject.toml, see "[pyproject.toml settings](pyproject-toml)".

## Next steps

After scaffolding your project with components, you can [add more components](adding-components) to complete your pipeline.
