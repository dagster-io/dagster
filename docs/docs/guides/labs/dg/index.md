`dg` is a new command line interface that provides a streamlined Dagster development experience. It is a drop-in replacement for the Dagster CLI that can be [used in existing projects](/guides/labs/dg/incrementally-adopting-dg/migrating-project) or used to [scaffold new Dagster projects](/guides/labs/dg/scaffolding-a-project). Once a project is set up to use `dg`, you can list, check, and scaffold Dagster definitions and [components](/guides/labs/components/) with ease. `dg` is designed to be globally installed and has no dependency on `dagster` itself.
