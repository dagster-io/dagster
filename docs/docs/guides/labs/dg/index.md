`dg` is a new command line interface that provides a streamlined Dagster development experience. It is a drop-in replacement for the Dagster CLI that can be [used in existing projects](/guides/labs/dg/incrementally-adopting-dg/migrating-project) or used to [scaffold new Dagster projects](/guides/labs/dg/creating-a-project). Once a project is set up to use `dg`, you can list, check, and scaffold Dagster definitions and [components](/guides/labs/components/) with ease.

:::note

`dg` is designed to be usable from an isolated environment and has no dependency on `dagster` itself.

## Installation

You can install `dg` with `uv` or `pip`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

First, install the Python package manager [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you don't have it:

<InstallUv />

Next, use `uv` to install `dg` as a globally available tool:

<CliInvocationExample contents="uv tool install dagster-dg" />

This installs `dg` into a hidden, isolated Python environment. The `dg` executable is always available in your `$PATH`, regardless of any virtual environment activation in the shell.

While it is possible to create a virtual environment and install `dagster-dg` into it with `uv`, we recommend a global installation for most users, since it only needs to be done once, and better supports multiple Python projects.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

If you are starting a project from scratch, run the following:

```
mkdir my_project && cd my_project
```

```
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are not starting a new project, first activate your desired virtual
environment, then install `dagster-dg`:

```
pip install dagster-dg
```

## `dg` CLI reference

Once you've installed `dg`, you can run `dg --help` on the command line to see all the commands, or check out the [`dg` CLI documentation](/guides/labs/dg/dagster-dg-cli).
