{/* TODO what is dg, who is it for, and why would they use it */}

The `dg` command line tool lives in the published Python package `dagster-dg`. `dg` is designed to be globally installed and has no dependency on `dagster` itself. `dg` allows you to quickly scaffold Dagster projects, and, if you wish, populate them with [components](/guides/labs/components/).
