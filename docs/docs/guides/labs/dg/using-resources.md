:::note Prerequisites

Before following this guide, you will need to [create a project](/guides/labs/dg/creating-a-project) with the `create-dagster` CLI.

:::

[Assets](/guides/build/assets), [asset checks](/guides/test/asset-checks), and [sensors](/guides/automate/sensors) in Dagster frequently require resources that are instantiated elsewhere in the project.

For example, if you have a resource defined at the root of your project in `src/resources.py`:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dg/using-resources/2-resources-at-defs-root.py" title="src/resources.py" />

You can make that resource available anywhere else in your project by creating a `Definitions` object that returns that resource:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dg/using-resources/3-resource-defs-at-project-root.py" title="src/resources.py" />

You can now use the resource elsewhere in your project - for example, in an asset defined in `defs/asset_one.py`:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dg/using-resources/1-asset-one.py" title="defs/asset_one.py"
 />


Resource binding can happen at any level of the `defs` hierarchy. If you moved `asset_one` in this example to a subdirectory, you could leave the existing `resources.py` file at `src/defs/resources.py`:

```
src
└── resource_docs
    ├── definitions.py
    ├── defs
    │   ├── assets
    │   │   └── asset_one.py # contains def asset_one():
    │   └── resources.py # contains AResource()
    └── resources.py # contains class AResource
```

## Scaffolding resources

To create a resource dictionary like the above, you can run the following:

```
dg scaffold defs dagster.resources path/to/resources.py
```

which will create

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dg/using-resources/4-scaffolded-resource-defs.py" />

and you can fill out the resource dictionary as needed.
