:::note

This is part two of the [Using Dagster Pipes to run a local subprocess](index.md) tutorial.

:::

At this point, you should have two files:

- `external_code.py` which is a standalone Python script that you want to orchestrate with Dagster.
- `dagster_code.py` which includes a Dagster asset and other Dagster definitions.

In this section, you'll learn how to modify the standalone Python script to work with [Dagster Pipes](/guides/build/external-pipelines/) in order to stream information back to Dagster. To do this, you'll:

- [Make Dagster context available in external code](#step-1-make-dagster-context-available-in-external-code)
- [Stream log messages back to Dagster](#step-2-send-log-messages-to-dagster)
- [Stream structured metadata back to Dagster](#step-3-send-structured-metadata-to-dagster)

## Step 1: Make Dagster context available in external code

Getting external code to send information back to Dagster via Dagster Pipes requires adding a few lines of code:

- Imports from `dagster-pipes`

- A call that connects to Dagster Pipes: <PyObject section="libraries" module="dagster_pipes" object="open_dagster_pipes"/> initializes the Dagster Pipes context that can be used to stream information back to Dagster. We recommend calling this function near the entry point of a pipes session.

  The `with open_dagster_pipes()` is a context manager in Python, ensuring resource setup and cleanup for a specific segment of code. It's useful for tasks requiring initial setup and final teardown, like opening and closing connections. In this case, the context manager is used to initialize and close the Dagster Pipes connection.

- An instance of the Dagster Pipes context via <PyObject section="libraries" module="dagster_pipes" object="PipesContext.get" />. You can access information like `partition_key` and `asset_key` via this context object. Refer to the [the API documentation](/api/python-api/libraries/dagster-pipes#dagster_pipes.PipesContext) for more information.

In our sample Python script, the changes would look like the following:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_2/step_1/external_code.py" lineStart="3" />

## Step 2: Send log messages to Dagster

Dagster Pipes context offers a built-in logging capability that enables you to stream log messages back to Dagster. Instead of printing to the standard output, you can use the `context.log` method on <PyObject section="libraries" module="dagster_pipes" object="PipesContext" /> to send log messages back to Dagster. In this case, we’re sending an `info` level log message:


<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_2/step_2/external_code.py" />

Then, the log messages will show up in the **Run details** page of the Dagster UI. You can filter the log levels to only view `info` level messages:

1. Click the **Levels** filter next to the log filter field. This will present a dropdown of all log levels.
2. Select the **info** checkbox and deselect the others. This will show only the logs marked as **info** level.

## Step 3: Send structured metadata to Dagster

Sometimes, you may want to log information from your external code as structured metadata shown in the Dagster UI. Dagster Pipes context also comes with the ability to log structured metadata back to Dagster.

### Report asset materialization

Similar to [reporting materialization metadata within the Dagster process](/guides/build/assets/metadata-and-tags/), you can also report asset materialization back to Dagster from the external process.

In this example, we’re passing a piece of metadata named `total_orders` to the `metadata` parameter of the <PyObject section="libraries" module="dagster_pipes" object="PipesContext" method="report_asset_materialization" />. This payload will be sent from the external process back to Dagster:


<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_2/step_3_materialization/external_code.py" />

Then, `total_orders` will show up in the UI as structured metadata:

![Report asset materialization to Dagster](/images/guides/build/external-pipelines/subprocess/part-2-step-3-report-asset-materialization.png)

This metadata will also be displayed on the **Events** tab of the **Asset Details** page in the UI:

![View materialization events in asset details page](/images/guides/build/external-pipelines/subprocess/part-2-step-3-asset-details.png)

### Report asset checks

Dagster allows you to define and execute data quality checks on assets. Refer to the [Asset Checks](/guides/test/asset-checks) documentation for more information.

If your asset has data quality checks defined, you can report to Dagster that an asset check has been performed via <PyObject section="libraries" module="dagster_pipes" object="PipesContext" method="report_asset_check" />:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Report from the external code">


<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess//part_2/step_3_check/external_code.py" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Define the asset in the Dagster code">

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_2/step_3_check/dagster_code.py" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When Dagster executes the code, you’ll see an asset check event with the check result in the UI:

![Report asset checks to Dagster](/images/guides/build/external-pipelines/subprocess/part-2-step-3-report-asset-check.png)
This check result will also be displayed on the **Checks** tab of the **Asset Details** page in the UI:

![View checks in asset details page](/images/guides/build/external-pipelines/subprocess/part-2-step-3-check-tab.png)

## Finished code

At this point, your two files should look like the following:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="External code in external_code.py">

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_2/step_3_check/external_code.py" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Dagster code in dagster_code.py">

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/dagster_pipes/subprocess/part_2/step_3_check/dagster_code.py" />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
