This guide demonstrates how to build memoizable graphs of assets. Memoizable assets help avoid unnecessary recomputations, speed up the developer workflow, and save computational resources.

## Context

There's no reason to spend time materializing an asset if the result is going to be the same as the result of its last materialization.

Dagster's versioning system helps you determine ahead of time whether materializing an asset will produce a different result. It's based on the idea that the result of an asset materialization shouldn't change as long as:

- The code used is the same code as the last time the asset was materialized.
- The input data is the same input data as the last time the asset was materialized.

Dagster has two versioning concepts to represent the code and input data used for each materialization:

- **Code version.** A string that represents the version of the code that computes an asset. This is the `code_version` argument of <PyObject section="assets" module="dagster" object="asset" decorator />.
- **Data version.** A string that represents the version of the data represented by the asset. This is represented as a `DataVersion` object.
{/* TODO link `DataVersion` to API docs */}

By keeping track of code and data versions, Dagster can predict whether a materialization will change the underlying value. This allows Dagster to skip redundant materializations and instead return the previously computed value. In more technical terms, Dagster offers a limited form of [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) for assets: the last-computed asset value is always cached.

In computationally expensive data pipelining, this approach can yield tremendous benefits.

## Step one: Understanding data versions

By default, Dagster automatically computes a data version for each materialization of an asset. It does this by hashing a code version together with the data versions of any input assets.

Let's start with a trivial asset that returns a hardcoded number:


<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/vanilla_asset.py" />

Next, start the Dagster UI:

```shell
dagster dev
```

Navigate to the **Asset catalog** and click **Materialize** to materialize the asset.

Next, look at the entry for the materialization. Take note of the two hashes in the **System tags** section of the materialization details - `code_version` and `data_version`:

![Simple asset data version](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/simple-asset-in-catalog.png)

The code version shown is a copy of the run ID for the run that generated this materialization. Because `a_number` has no user-defined `code_version`, Dagster assumes a different code version on every run, which it represents with the run ID.

The `data_version` is also generated by Dagster. This is a hash of the code version together with the data versions of any inputs. Since `a_number` has no inputs, in this case, the data version is a hash of the code version only.

If you materialize the asset again, you'll notice that both the code version and data version change. The code version becomes the ID of the new run and the data version becomes a hash of the new code version.

Let's improve this situation by setting an explicit code version. Add a `code_version` on the asset:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/vanilla_asset_with_code_version.py" />

Now, materialize the asset. The user-defined code version `v1` will be associated with the latest materialization:

![Simple asset data version with code version](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/simple-asset-with-code-version-in-catalog.png)

Now, let's update the code and inform Dagster that the code has changed. Do this by changing the `code_version` argument:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/vanilla_asset_with_code_version_v2.py" />

Click **Reload definitions** to pick up the changes.

![Simple asset data version with code version](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/simple-asset-with-code-version-in-asset-graph.png)

The asset now has a label to indicate that its code version has changed since it was last materialized. We can see this in both the asset graph and the sidebar, where details about the last materialization of a selected node are visible. You can see the code version associated with the last materialization of `versioned_number` is `v1`, but its current code version is `v2`. This is also explained in the tooltip that appears if you hover over the `(i)` icon on the indicator tag.

The `versioned_number` asset must be materialized again to become up-to-date. Click the toggle to the right side of the **Materialize** button to display the **Propagate changes** option. Clicking this will propagate the changed code version by materializing `versioned_number`. This will update the latest materialization `code_version` shown in the sidebar to `v2` and bring the asset up-to-date.

## Step two: data versions with dependencies

Tracking changes becomes more powerful when there are dependencies in play. Let's add an asset downstream of our first asset:


<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/dependencies_code_version_only.py" />

In the Dagster UI, click **Reload definitions**. The `multipled_number` asset will be marked as **Never materialized**.

Next, click the toggle to the right side of the **Materialize** button to display the **Propagate changes** option. As the **Materialize** button ignores versioning, we need this option to ensure the `multipled_number` asset is properly materialized.

In the created run, only the step associated with `multiplied_number` is run. The system knows that `versioned_number` is up to date and therefore can safely skip that computation. You can see this on the details page for the run:

![Materialize stale event log](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/materialize-stale-event-log.png)

Now, let's update the `versioned_number` asset. Specifically, we'll change its return value and code version:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/dependencies_code_version_only_v2.py" />

As before, this will cause `versioned_number` to get a label indicating that its code version has changed since its latest materialization. But since `multiplied_number` depends on `versioned_number`, it must be recomputed as well and so gets a label indicating that the code version of an upstream asset has changed. If you hover over the **Upstream code version** tag on `multiplied_number`, you will see the upstream asset whose code version has changed:

![Dependencies code version only](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/dependencies-code-version-only.png)

Click **Propagate changes** to get both assets up-to-date again.

## Step three: Computing your own data versions

A data version is like a fingerprint for the value that an asset represents, i.e. the output of its materialization function. Therefore, we want our data versions to correspond on a one-to-one basis to the possible return values of a materialization function. Dagster auto-generates data versions by hashing the code version together with input data versions. This satisfies the above criterion in many cases, but sometimes a different approach is necessary.

For example, when a materialization function contains an element of randomness, then multiple materializations of the asset with the same code over the same inputs will produce the same data version for different outputs. On the flip side, if we are generating code versions with an automated approach like source-hashing, then materializing an asset after a cosmetic refactor will produce a different data version (which is derived from the code version) but the same output.

Dagster accommodates these and similar scenarios by allowing user code to supply its own data versions. To do so, include the data version alongside the returned asset value in an <PyObject section="ops" module="dagster" object="Output" /> object. Let's update `versioned_number` to do this. For simplicity, you'll use the stringified return value as the data version:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/manual_data_versions_1.py" />

Both assets get labels to indicate that they're impacted by the new code version of `versioned_number`. Let's re-materialize them both to make them fresh. Notice the `DataVersion` of `versioned_number` is now `20`:

![Manual data versions 1](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/manual-data-versions-1.png)

Let's simulate a cosmetic refactor by updating `versioned_number` again, but without changing the returned value. Bump the code version to `v5` and change `20` to `10 + 10`:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/manual_data_versions_2.py" />

Once again, both assets have labels to indicate the change in the code version. Dagster doesn't know that `v5` of the versioned number will return the same value as `v4`, as it only knows about code versions and data versions.

Let's see what happens if only `versioned_number` is materialized. Select it in the asset graph and click **Materialize selected**. The sidebar shows the latest materialization now has a code_version of `v5`, and the data version is again `20`:

![Manual data versions 2](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/manual-data-versions-2.png)

Notice that `multiplied_number` no longer has a label, even though we didn't materialize it! Here's what happened: the new materialization of `versioned_number` with the explicitly supplied data version supersedes the code version of `versioned_number`. Dagster then compared the data version of `versioned_number` last used to materialize `multiplied_number` to the current data version of `versioned_number`. Since this comparison shows that the data version of `versioned_number` hasn't changed, Dagster knows that the change to the code version of `versioned_number` doesn't affect `multiplied_number`.

If `versioned_number` had used a Dagster-generated data version, the data version of `versioned_number` would have changed due to its updated code version despite the fact that the returned value did not change. `multiplied_number` would have a label indicating that an upstream data version had changed.

## Step four: data versions with source assets

In the real world, data pipelines depend on external upstream data. So far in this guide, we haven't used any external data; we've been substituting hardcoded data in the asset at the root of our graph and using a code version as a stand-in for the version of that data. We can do better than this.

External data sources in Dagster are modeled by <PyObject section="assets" module="dagster" object="SourceAsset" pluralize />. We can add versioning to a `SourceAsset` by making it observable. An observable source asset has a user-defined function that computes and returns a data version.

Let's add an <PyObject section="assets" module="dagster" object="observable_source_asset" decorator="true" /> called `input_number`. This will represent a file written by an external process upstream of our pipeline:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/input_number.txt" />

The body of the `input_number` function computes a hash of the file contents and returns it as a `DataVersion`. We'll set `input_number` as an upstream dependency of `versioned_number` and have `versioned_number` return the value it reads from the file:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/observable_source_asset_path_with_non_argument_deps.py" />

Adding an observable source asset to an asset graph will cause a new button, **Observe sources**, to appear:

![Source asset in graph](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/source-asset-in-graph.png)

Click this button to kick off a run that executes the observation function of `input_number`. Let's look at the entry in the asset catalog for `input_number`:

![Source asset in catalog](/images/guides/build/assets/asset-versioning-and-caching/source-asset-in-catalog.png)

Take note of the `data_version` listed here that you computed.

We also see that `versioned_number` and `multiplied_number` have labels indicating that they have new upstream dependencies (because we added the observable source asset to the graph). Click **Materialize all** to bring them up to date.

Finally, let's manually alter the file to simulate the activity of an external process. Change the content of `input_number.txt`:

<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/dagster/asset_versioning_and_caching/input_number_v2.txt" />

If we click the **Observe Sources** button again, the downstream assets will again have labels indicating that upstream data has changed. The observation run generated a new data version for `input_number` because its content changed.
