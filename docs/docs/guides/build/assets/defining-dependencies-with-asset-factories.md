title: Defining dependencies with asset factories

When building asset factories with [components](/guides/build/components), you often need to define dependencies between the generated assets. For example, you may have ETL tables where some tables depend on others.

This guide shows how to:
- Define dependencies between component-generated assets
- Create regular assets that depend on component-generated assets

:::note

This guide assumes familiarity with [asset factories](/guides/build/assets/creating-asset-factories).

:::

## Defining inter-dependencies between component assets

To define dependencies between assets generated by a component, include a `deps` field in your component's Model. This allows users to specify dependencies in the YAML configuration.

First, define the Model with a `deps` field:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory_with_deps/etl_table_component.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/<project_name>/components/etl_table_component.py"
  startAfter="start_etl_table_model"
  endBefore="end_etl_table_model"
/>

Then, use the `deps` field when creating assets in the component:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory_with_deps/etl_table_component.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/<project_name>/components/etl_table_component.py"
  startAfter="start_etl_table_component"
  endBefore="end_etl_table_component"
/>

Now you can define assets with dependencies in YAML. In this example, `risky_transactions` depends on both `cleaned_transactions` and `risky_customers`:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory_with_deps/defs.yaml"
  language="yaml"
  title="src/<project_name>/defs/etl_tables/defs.yaml"
/>

## Defining regular assets downstream of component assets

You can create regular assets that depend on component-generated assets by referencing their asset keys:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory_with_deps/downstream_asset.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/<project_name>/defs/downstream_asset.py"
/>
