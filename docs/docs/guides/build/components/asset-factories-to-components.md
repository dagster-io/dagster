Data engineers often need to implement multiple similar workflows in data pipelines. To keep this code maintainable, many engineers use [asset factories](/guides/build/assets/creating-asset-factories) to generate Dagster objects based on configuration instead of defining each one manually.

While factories are powerful and flexible, many patterns that use them can also be expressed using [components](/guides/build/components). In this guide, we will implement the asset factory from the [asset factory creation guide](/guides/build/assets/creating-asset-factories) into a custom component.

:::note Prerequisites

Before scaffolding a custom component, you must either [create a components-ready Dagster project](/guides/build/projects/creating-a-new-project) or [migrate an existing project to `dg`](/guides/build/projects/moving-to-components/migrating-project).

:::

## 1. Scaffold the custom component

When creating a new custom component in Dagster, the first step is to scaffold the component using `dg`. This generates the necessary boilerplate code and file structure for you to implement and register the component:

<CliInvocationExample contents="dg scaffold component AssetFactory" />

## 2. Define the component

Next, we will need to define the component. We recommend beginning new components by designing the interface. In the case of our asset factory, there is one set resource and one or more ETL assets that will be configured. Since there will be a number of ETL assets configured, we will need to define a `Model` that can be used in the component.

Looking at the parameters of the `build_etl_job` factory, we can see what needs to be in the model:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory/asset_factory.py"
  language="python"
  startAfter="start_build_etl_job"
  endBefore="end_build_etl_job"
/>

Within the component code in `asset_factory.py`, we will create a class that inherits from `dg.Model` with the attributes of the asset factory:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory/asset_factory_component.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/<project_name>/components/asset_factory.py"
  startAfter="start_etl_job_model"
  endBefore="end_etl_job_model"
/>

Next, we can use that Model within the `AssetFactory` class. At the top of the class, create attributes for `access_key_id` and  `secret_access_key`. These will be shared across the assets and only need to be set once. The `etl_job` attribute will be a list since it can be any number of assets:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory/asset_factory_component.py"
  language="python"
  title="src/<project_name>/components/asset_factory.py"
  startAfter="start_asset_factory_component"
  endBefore="end_asset_factory_component"
/>

Most of the new `AssetFactory` code will look similar to the code in the old asset factory, although the <PyObject section="definitions" module="dagster" object="Definitions" />  object returned contains all of the assets that will be generated, as well as the resource.

## 3. Use the component

With the component created and registered, we can now use it in the project. The first step is to initialize the component:

<CliInvocationExample contents="dg scaffold defs 'my_project.components.asset_factory.AssetFactory' asset_factory" />

Next, set the attributes of the component:

<CodeExample
  path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/components/asset_factory/defs.yaml"
  language="yaml"
  title="src/<project_name>/defs/asset_factory/defs.yaml"
/>

## 4. Viewing component assets

The assets generated by the initialized component behave the same as those created by the factory. You can view them on the command line:

<CliInvocationExample contents="dg list defs" />

or interact with them in the Dagster UI by running `dg dev`:
