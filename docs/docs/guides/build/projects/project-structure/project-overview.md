This reference contains details about the [default files and directories](#default) and [additional deployment configuration files](#deployment-config) in a Dagster project.

## Default files and directories \{#default}

Below is the default project structure generated by the `create-dagster project` command:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/uv-tree-project.txt" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/pip-tree-project.txt" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

To use `tree`, install it with `brew install tree` (Mac), or follow the [installation instructions](https://oldmanprogrammer.net/source.php?dir=projects/tree/INSTALL) (Windows and Linux).

:::

| File or directory | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `src/my_project`  | Python package that contains the deployable code that defines your Dagster pipelines. |
| `src/my_project/definitions.py` | The entry point that Dagster will load when deploying your project.   |
| `src/my_project/defs` | Will contain your Dagster definitions and [component](/guides/build/components) definitions. |
| `src/my_project/components` (not pictured) |  An optional folder used to define [custom components](/guides/build/components/creating-new-components), and optionally other code you wish to share across Dagster definitions. |
| `tests` | A separate Python package defined at the top level (outside `src`). It should contain tests for the `my_project` package. |
| `pyproject.toml` | A standard [Python package configuration file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/). In addition to the regular Python package metadata, it contains a `tool.dg` section for `dg`-specific settings. |

## Dagster instance and deployment configuration files \{#deployment-config}

Depending on your use case or if you're using Dagster+, you may also need to add additional configuration files to your project. To see how these files might fit into your project, see the [Deployment-specific project structures section](#deployment-specific-project-structures).

| File/Directory | Description | OSS | Dagster+ |
|----------------|-------------|-----|----------|
| dagster.yaml   | Configures your Dagster instance, including defining storage locations, run launchers, sensors, and schedules. For more information. including a list of use cases and available options, see the [`dagster.yaml` reference](/deployment/oss/dagster-yaml).<br /><br />For [Dagster+ Hybrid deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid), this file can be used to customize the [Hybrid agent](/deployment/dagster-plus/management/customizing-agent-settings). | Optional | Optional |
| build.yaml | Defines projects for Dagster+ deployment. For more information, see the [`build.yaml` reference](/guides/build/projects/project-structure/dagster-cloud-yaml). | Not applicable | Recommended for Dagster+ Hybrid |
| deployment_settings.yaml | Configures settings for full deployments in Dagster+, including run queue priority and concurrency limits. For more information, see the [full deployment settings reference](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/full-deployments/full-deployment-settings-reference).<br /><br />**Note:** This file can be named anything, but we recommend choosing a name that is easy to understand. | Not applicable | Optional |
| dg.toml | Defines multiple Dagster projects in a workspace for local development or deploying to a production OSS deployment. For more information and available options, see the [`dg.toml` file reference](/guides/build/projects/workspaces/dg.toml) | Optional | TK |
| .github/dagster-plus-deploy.yml | TK | Not applicable | Dagster+ Serverless only |
| .github/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml | TK | Not applicable | Dagster+ Hybrid only |

## Deployment-specific project structures

Using the default project skeleton, let's take a look at how some example Dagster projects would be structured in the following deployment scenarios:

- [Local development](#local-development)
- [Dagster Open Source deployment](#dagster-open-source-deployment)
- [Dagster+ deployment](#dagster-deployment)

:::note Configuration file location

With the exception of [`build.yaml`](/guides/build/projects/project-structure/dagster-cloud-yaml), it's not necessary for configuration files to be located with your project files. These files typically need to be located in `DAGSTER_HOME`. For example, in larger deployments, `DAGSTER_HOME` and Dagster infrastructure configuration can be managed separately from the projects they support.

:::

### Local development

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Single Dagster project">

For local development, a [single Dagster project](/guides/build/projects/creating-projects) might look like this:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv" >

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/uv-tree-project.txt" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/pip-tree-project.txt" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Multiple Dagster projects">

For local development, a [workspace with multiple Dagster projects](/guides/build/projects/workspaces/creating-workspaces) might look like this:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="uv" value="uv">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/uv-tree-workspace.txt" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pip" value="pip">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/pip-tree-workspace.txt" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Dagster Open Source deployment

Once you're ready to move from working locally to deploying Dagster to your infrastructure, use our [deployment guides](/deployment/oss/deployment-options) to get up and running. Dagster projects and workspaces deployed to OSS will have the same structure as the [local development](#local-development) examples, with the addition of an optional `dagster.yaml` Dagster instance configuration file, along with any deployment-specific configuration files required by your deployment type.

### Dagster+ deployment

Depending on whether you're using Dagster+ Serverless or Hybrid, your project structure might look slightly different.

#### Dagster+ Serverless

For a Dagster+ Serverless deployment, a project might look like this:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/uv-tree-project-serverless.txt" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/pip-tree-project-serverless.txt" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info GitHub Actions workflow file

If you use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, your project will also contain a `.github/dagster-plus-deploy.yml` file. For more information on configuring CI/CD for Dagster+ Serverless, including with non-GitHub providers, see [CI/CD in Dagster+ Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/ci-cd/ci-cd-in-serverless).

:::

#### Dagster+ Hybrid deployment

For a Dagster+ Hybrid deployment, a project might look like this:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">

  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/uv-tree-project-hybrid.txt" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/pip-tree-project-hybrid.txt" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info GitHub Actions workflow file

If you use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, your project will also contain a `.github/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml` file. For more information on configuring CI/CD for Dagster+ Hybrid, including with non-GitHub providers, see [CI/CD in Dagster+ Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/ci-cd/ci-cd-in-hybrid).
