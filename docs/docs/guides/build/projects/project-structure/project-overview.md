This reference contains details about the [default files and directories](#default) and [additional deployment configuration files](#deployment-config) in a Dagster project.

## Default files and directories \{#default}

Below is the default project structure generated by the `create-dagster project` command:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager">
  <TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/uv-tree-project.txt" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pip" label="pip">

  <CliInvocationExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/guides/projects/pip-tree-project.txt" />

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

| File or directory | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `src/my_project`  | Python package that contains the deployable code that defines your Dagster pipelines. |
| `src/my_project/definitions.py` | The entry point that Dagster will load when deploying your project.   |
| `src/my_project/defs` | Will contain your Dagster definitions and [component](/guides/build/components) definitions. |
| `src/my_project/components` (not pictured) |  An optional folder used to define [custom components](/guides/build/components/creating-new-components), and optionally other code you wish to share across Dagster definitions. |
| `tests` | A separate Python package defined at the top level (outside `src`). It should contain tests for the `my_project` package. |
| `pyproject.toml` | A standard [Python package configuration file](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/). In addition to the regular Python package metadata, it contains a `tool.dg` section for `dg`-specific settings. |

## Dagster instance and deployment configuration files \{#deployment-config}

Depending on your use case or if you're using Dagster+, you may also need to add additional configuration files to your project.

| File/Directory | Description | OSS | Dagster+ | Created by |
|----------------|-------------|-----|----------|------------|
| dagster.yaml   | Configures your Dagster instance, including defining storage locations, run launchers, sensors, and schedules. For more information. including a list of use cases and available options, see the [`dagster.yaml` reference](/deployment/oss/dagster-yaml).<br /><br />For [Dagster+ Hybrid deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid), this file can be used to customize the [Hybrid agent](/deployment/dagster-plus/management/customizing-agent-settings). | Optional | Optional | Manually created |
| deployment_settings.yaml | Configures settings for [full deployments](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/full-deployments) in Dagster+, including run queue priority and concurrency limits. See the [full deployment settings reference](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/full-deployments/full-deployment-settings-reference).<br /><br />**Note:** This file can be named anything, but we recommend choosing a name that is easy to understand. | Not applicable | Optional | Manually created |
| build.yaml | Defines projects for Dagster+ deployment. See the [`build.yaml` reference](/deployment/dagster-plus/management/build-yaml). | Not applicable | Dagster+ Hybrid only | [`dg plus deploy configure` CLI command](/api/clis/dg-cli/dg-plus#configure) |
| Dockerfile | Contains instructions to build a Docker image for use in a Dagster deployment. | Not applicable | Dagster+ Hybrid only | [`dg plus deploy configure` CLI command](/api/clis/dg-cli/dg-plus#configure) |

## CI/CD configuration files

- For **OSS deployments**, you can add your own CI/CD files as needed.
- For **Dagter+ deployments**, you can use the [`dg plus deploy configure` CLI command](/api/clis/dg-cli/dg-plus#configure) to generate CI/CD files for GitHub or GitLab, or set your system to use the necessary `dg deploy` CLI commands if you use a different Git provider. For more information, see the [Dagster+ CI/CD documentation](/deployment/dagster-plus/deploying-code/ci-cd).
