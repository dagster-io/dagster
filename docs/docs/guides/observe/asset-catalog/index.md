The Dagster+ version of the asset catalog page displays assets broken out by compute kind, asset group, [code location](/deployment/code-locations), [tags](/guides/build/assets/metadata-and-tags/tags), owners, and more. On this page, you can:

- View all assets in your Dagster deployment
- View details about a specific asset by clicking on it
- Search assets by asset key, compute kind, asset group, code location, tags, owners, and more
- Build dashboards scoped by tags, teams, owners, or asset groups
- Access the global asset lineage
- Reload definitions

To access the asset catalog, click **Catalog** in the top navigation.
