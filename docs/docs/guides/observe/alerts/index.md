Dagster+ alerts can notify you of critical events occurring in your deployment so you can catch potential issues early, helping you resolve problems before they impact your stakeholders.

To create a Dagster+ alert, [configure an alert notification service](/guides/observe/alerts/configuring-an-alert-notification-service), then [create an alert policy](/guides/observe/alerts/creating-alerts) to define the conditions that will trigger an alert and the notification service that will be used to send it.
