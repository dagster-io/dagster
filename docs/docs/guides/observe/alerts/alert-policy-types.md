| **Asset**                          | **Asset health** - Degraded, warning, or healthy. Sends a notification when the overall [health status](/guides/observe/asset-health-status) of the asset changes.<br /><br />**Asset materializations** - Failure or success. If you use a RetryPolicy, an alert will only be sent after all retries complete.<br /><br />**[Asset checks](/guides/test/asset-checks)** - Error, warn, passed, or failure to execute. By default, failed asset checks have a severity of `WARN`.<br /><br />**Asset freshness** - Failure, warning, or passing. Sends a notification when the [freshness status](/guides/observe/asset-freshness-policies) of an asset changes. | Asset alerts can either notify on health changes or individual events, but not both.<br /><br />Asset alerts can be scoped to asset groups or specific asset keys. Asset check alerts are sent for any checks on those assets.<br /><br />On **Dagster+ Pro**, asset alerts also allow you to send alerts to [asset owners](/guides/build/assets/metadata-and-tags#owners).<br /><br />[External assets](/guides/build/assets/external-assets) do not trigger asset alerts. | [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) and [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) deployments |
| **Run**                            | Triggers on job run success, failure, or time limit exceeded; may optionally include a set of configured tags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | If an alert policy has no configured tags, all jobs will be eligible for that alert. Otherwise, only jobs that contain all the tags for a given alert policy are eligible for that alert.<br /><br />Each newly created organization starts with a long-running run alert policy, which sends an email to the email address used to create the organization when a job run exceeds 24 hours.                                                                                | [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) and [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) deployments |
| **Code location**                  | Triggers when a code location fails to load due to an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) and [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) deployments |
| **Automation**                     | Triggers when a tick failure occurs for schedules or sensors in the deployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Alerts are sent only when the schedule/sensor changes from **success** to **failure**, so subsequent failures won't trigger new alerts. You can also configure alerts to only fire after multiple consecutive failures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) and [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) deployments |
| **Agent downtime**                 | Triggers when a Hybrid agent hasn't heartbeated within the last five minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) deployments only.                                                 |
| **Insights metric** (Experimental) | Triggers when a [Dagster+ Insights](/guides/observe/insights) metric exceeds or falls below a specified threshold over a specified time window. This can be used to alert on:<ul><li>Dagster credit usage across a deployment or for a specific job</li><li>Performance regressions on asset or job runtime</li><li>Spend on external tools such as Snowflake or BigQuery credits</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Alerts can be scoped to the sum of any metric across an entire deployment, or for a specific job, asset group, or asset key.<br /><br />Alerts are sent only when the threshold is first crossed, and will not be sent again until the value returns to expected levels. Insights data may become available up to 24 hours after run completion.                                                                                                                            | [Serverless](/deployment/dagster-plus/serverless) and [Hybrid](/deployment/dagster-plus/hybrid) deployments |

:::info Asset health alerts

To make health alert notifications as relevant as possible, they only notify once when the health status of the asset changes, instead of every time an event occurs. This makes them different from the existing event-based alerts.

For example, assume you have set up an asset health alert to notify when an asset becomes degraded. If the asset is healthy, but fails to materialize after a run begins, then the asset's health status is degraded, and you will receive a health alert notification. If another run for the asset begins, and the asset again fails to materialize, you will not receive a new notification. (An alert configured to notify on materialization failures would continue to send notifications in this case.)
