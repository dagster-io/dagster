# Dagit UI

Dagit is a web-based interface for viewing and interacting with Dagster objects.

You can inspect op, job, and graph definitions, launch runs, view launched runs, and view assets produced by those runs.

To launch the Dagit web server, run `dagit`. The command will print out the URL you can access the interface from in the browser, usually on port 3000.

Dagit fetches definitions - jobs, ops, schedules, sensors - from a set of repositories configured in `workspace.yaml`. It fetches runs and assets from storage, configured in an instance's `dagster.yaml`.

These are the main pages inside Dagit:

## Job

The Job page offers tools to explore a job definition and launch runs for that job.

### Job Definition

The Overview tab shows the graph of ops that make up a job. Selecting an op reveals detailed metadata about it in the pane to the right.

## Runs

The Runs page lists all job runs. You can filter the list by job name, run ID, execution status, or tag. Click a run ID to view details for that run.

### Viewing a single run

The Run page provides details for a single run, including timing information, errors, and logs.

The upper left pane contains a Gantt chart, indicating how long each op took to execute. The bottom pane displays filterable events and logs emitted during the course of execution.

### Re-executing a run

The Run page also allows you to re-execute a run with the same configuration. Click the "Re-execution" dropdown button. There are several re-execution options:

/>

- **All Steps**: Re-execute the run from scratch.
- **Selected Steps**: Re-execute the selected steps.
- **From Selected**: Re-execute the steps downstream from the selected steps
- **From Failure**: Retry the run, skipping steps completed successfully. This is only enabled when the run has failed.

Related runs (e.g., runs created by re-executing the same previous run) are now grouped together in the right pane for easy reference.

## Assets

The Assets page lists all assets. You can filter the list by asset key.

Clicking each schedule, you can find details about a single schedule, its recent tick history, and recent runs.

### Sensors

Clicking each sensor, you can find details about a single sensor, its recent tick history, and recent runs.

## Instance Status

The Instance status page includes information about the status of the repositories in your workspace, daemon health, schedules, sensors, and configuration details.
