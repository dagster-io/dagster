# GraphQL Python Client

Dagster provides a GraphQL Python Client to interface with <Link href="/concepts/dagit/graphql">Dagster's GraphQL API</Link> from Python.

## Overview

The Dagster Python Client provides bindings in Python to programmatically interact with Dagster's GraphQL API.

When is this useful? Dagster exposes a powerful GraphQL API, but this level of flexibility is not always necessary. For example, when submitting a new job run, you may only want to think about the job name and configuration and to think less about maintaining a long GraphQL query.

`DagsterGraphQLClient` provides a way to solve this issue by providing a module with a simple interface to interact with the GraphQL API.

Note that all GraphQL methods on the API are not yet available in Python - the `DagsterGraphQLClient` currently only provides the following methods:

- <PyObject
  module="dagster_graphql"
  object="DagsterGraphQLClient"
  method="submit_job_execution"
  />
- <PyObject
  module="dagster_graphql"
  object="DagsterGraphQLClient"
  method="get_run_status"
  />
- <PyObject
  module="dagster_graphql"
  object="DagsterGraphQLClient"
  method="reload_repository_location"
  />
- <PyObject
  module="dagster_graphql"
  object="DagsterGraphQLClient"
  method="shutdown_repository_location"
  />

## Using the GraphQL Client

The snippet below shows example instantiation of the client:

```python file=/concepts/dagit/graphql/client_example.py startafter=start_setup_marker endbefore=end_setup_marker
from dagster_graphql import DagsterGraphQLClient

client = DagsterGraphQLClient("localhost", port_number=3000)
```

## Examples

### Getting a Job Run's Status

You can use the client to get the status of a job run as follows:

```python file=/concepts/dagit/graphql/client_example.py startafter=start_run_status_marker endbefore=end_run_status_marker
from dagster_graphql import DagsterGraphQLClientError
from dagster import DagsterRunStatus

try:
    status: DagsterRunStatus = client.get_run_status(RUN_ID)
    if status == DagsterRunStatus.SUCCESS:
        do_something_on_success()
    else:
        do_something_else()
except DagsterGraphQLClientError as exc:
    do_something_with_exc(exc)
    raise exc
```

### Reloading all Repositories in a Repository Location

You can also reload a repository location in a Dagster deployment.

This reloads all repositories in that repository location. This is useful in a variety of contexts, including refreshing Dagit without restarting the server. Example usage is as follows:

```python file=/concepts/dagit/graphql/client_example.py startafter=start_reload_repo_location_marker endbefore=end_reload_repo_location_marker
from dagster_graphql import (
    ReloadRepositoryLocationInfo,
    ReloadRepositoryLocationStatus,
)

reload_info: ReloadRepositoryLocationInfo = client.reload_repository_location(REPO_NAME)
if reload_info.status == ReloadRepositoryLocationStatus.SUCCESS:
    do_something_on_success()
else:
    raise Exception(
        "Repository location reload failed because of a "
        f"{reload_info.failure_type} error: {reload_info.message}"
    )
```

### Submitting a Job Run

You can use the client to submit a job run as follows:

```python file=/concepts/dagit/graphql/client_example.py startafter=start_submit_marker_default endbefore=end_submit_marker_default
from dagster_graphql import DagsterGraphQLClientError

try:
    new_run_id: str = client.submit_job_execution(
        JOB_NAME,
        repository_location_name=REPO_LOCATION_NAME,
        repository_name=REPO_NAME,
        run_config={},
    )
    do_something_on_success(new_run_id)
except DagsterGraphQLClientError as exc:
    do_something_with_exc(exc)
    raise exc
```

### Shutting down a Repository Location Server

If you're running your own gRPC server, we generally recommend updating your repository code by building a new Docker image with a new tag and redeploying your server using that new image, but sometimes you may want to restart your server without changing the image (for example, if your job definitions are generated programatically from a database, and you want to restart the server and re-generate your repositories even though the underlying Python code hasn't changed). In these situations, `reload_repository_location` is insufficient, since it refreshes Dagit's information about the repositories but doesn't actually restart the server or reload the repository definition.

One way to cause your server to restart and your repositories to be reloaded is to run your server in an environment like Kubernetes that automatically restarts services when they fail (or docker-compose with `restart: always` set on the service), and then use the `shutdown_repository_location` function on the GraphQL client to shut down the server. The server will then be restarted by your environment, which will be automatically detected by Dagit.

Example usage:

```python file=/concepts/dagit/graphql/client_example.py startafter=start_shutdown_repo_location_marker endbefore=end_shutdown_repo_location_marker
from dagster_graphql import (
    ShutdownRepositoryLocationInfo,
    ShutdownRepositoryLocationStatus,
)

shutdown_info: ShutdownRepositoryLocationInfo = client.shutdown_repository_location(REPO_NAME)
if shutdown_info.status == ShutdownRepositoryLocationStatus.SUCCESS:
    do_something_on_success()
else:
    raise Exception(f"Repository location shutdown failed: {shutdown_info.message}")
```

#### Repository Location and Repository Inference

Note that specifying the repository location name and repository name are not always necessary; the GraphQL client will infer the repository name and repository location name if the job name is unique.

```python file=/concepts/dagit/graphql/client_example.py startafter=start_submit_marker_job_name_only endbefore=end_submit_marker_job_name_only
from dagster_graphql import DagsterGraphQLClientError

try:
    new_run_id: str = client.submit_job_execution(
        JOB_NAME,
        run_config={},
    )
    do_something_on_success(new_run_id)
except DagsterGraphQLClientError as exc:
    do_something_with_exc(exc)
    raise exc
```
