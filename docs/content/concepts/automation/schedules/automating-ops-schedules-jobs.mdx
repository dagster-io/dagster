# Automating ops using schedules and jobs

In this guide, we'll walk you through running ops on a schedule. To do this for asset definitions, refer to the [Automating assets using schedules guide](/concepts/automation/schedules/automating-assets-schedules-jobs).

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- Create a job that executes ops
- Create a schedule
- Add the new job and schedule to your project's <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object
- Turn the schedule on

---

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you'll need:

- **To install Dagster and the Dagster UI.** Refer to the [Installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more info and instructions.
- **Familiarity with**:
  - [Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops)
  - [Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)
  - [Code locations](/concepts/code-locations) (<PyObject object="Definitions" />)

---

## Step 1: Create a job

The first step in creating a schedule is to build a job that executes some ops.

Let's assume we already have a few ops in our project. To create a job that executes the ops, we'll use the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> decorator to define the job:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_op_schedule.py startafter=start_op_job endbefore=end_op_job
@op
def count_orders():
    return 5


@op
def count_users(arg):
    return arg + 1


@job
def ecommerce_job():
    count_users(count_orders())
```

To create the job, we:

1. Imported <PyObject object="job" />
2. Constructed the job using the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> decorator and name it `ecommerce_job`
3. Within the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> function's body, we used function calls to define dependencies between the `count_orders` and `count_users` ops

Refer to the [Op jobs documentation](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-jobs) for more info and examples.

---

## Step 2: Define the schedule

Next, we'll construct the schedule using <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> and attach it to the job we created in [Step 1](#step-1-create-a-job).

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_op_schedule.py startafter=start_schedule endbefore=end_schedule
ecommerce_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=ecommerce_job,
    cron_schedule="15 5 * * 1-5",
    default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING,
)
```

To build the schedule, we:

1. Imported DefaultScheduleStatus and <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> from `dagster`
2. Created a schedule using <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> that:

   - Is attached to the `ecommerce_job` job
   - Has a cron expression of `15 5 * * 1-5`, which translates to `Every Monday through Friday of every month at 5:15AM`
   - Is turned on by default (`default_status`). We'll discuss this more in [Step 4](#step-4-turn-the-schedule-on).

---

## Step 3: Update the Definitions object

Next, we'll update our project's <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object to include the new job and schedule. This ensures the job and schedule are available to Dagster processes, such as the Dagster UI.

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_op_schedule.py startafter=start_definitions endbefore=end_definitions
defs = Definitions(
    jobs=[ecommerce_job],
    schedules=[ecommerce_schedule],
)
```

At this point, your code should look like the following:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_op_schedule.py lines=3-5,7-21,25-31,35-38
from dagster import job, op, DefaultScheduleStatus, Definitions, ScheduleDefinition


@op
def count_orders():
    return 5


@op
def count_users(arg):
    return arg + 1


@job
def ecommerce_job():
    count_users(count_orders())


ecommerce_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=ecommerce_job,
    cron_schedule="15 5 * * 1-5",
    default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING,
)


defs = Definitions(
    jobs=[ecommerce_job],
    schedules=[ecommerce_schedule],
)
```

---

## Step 4: Turn the schedule on

turned the schedule on by using the `default_status` parameter in its <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />, but there are a few other ways to do this:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Dagster UI">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Starting or stopping a schedule in the UI will
  override any default status set in code.
</Note>

To turn on a schedule in the Dagster UI, navigate to **Overview > Schedules**:

<!-- ![Schedules tab in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules/schedules-tab-toggle.png) -->

<Image
alt="Schedules tab in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules/schedules-tab-toggle.png"
width={1920}
height={512}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="CLI">

To start and stop schedules via the [dagster CLI](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-schedule), use the following commands:

```shell
dagster schedule start
dagster schedule stop
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Python code">

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Starting or stopping a schedule in the UI will
  override any default status set in code.
</Note>

You can set the schedule's default status using `DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING` in the schedule's <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/basic_op_schedule.py startafter=start_schedule endbefore=end_schedule
ecommerce_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=ecommerce_job,
    cron_schedule="15 5 * * 1-5",
    default_status=DefaultScheduleStatus.RUNNING,
)
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

After the schedule is started, it will begin executing immediately if the [dagster-daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) process is running. This process starts automatically when `dagster dev` is run.

<!-- TODO: Refer to the [Troubleshooting schedules](/concepts/schedules/troubleshooting) guide if the schedule has been started but isn't submitting runs. -->

<!-- TODO: ## What's next?

That's it! At this point, you should have a working, running schedule in your Dagster project. From here, you can:

- Check out the [Schedule examples](/concepts/schedules/examples) for ideas and inspiration
- Create [tests for your schedules](/concepts/schedules/testing) to make sure things are running smoothly
- Refer to the [Automating pipelines guide](/guides/dagster/automating-pipelines) for more pipeline automation ideas
