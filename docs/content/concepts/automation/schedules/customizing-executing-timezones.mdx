# Customizing a schedule's executing timezone

[Schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules) that don't have a set timezone will, by default, execute in [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time). By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:

- Set custom timezones on schedule definitions
- Set custom timezones on partitioned jobs
- Account for the impact of Daylight Savings Time on schedule execution times

---

## Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you need to be familiar with:

- [Schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules)
- Jobs, either [asset](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) or [op-based](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-jobs)
- [Partitions](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitions) (Optional)

## Setting timezones on schedule definitions

Using the `execution_timezone` parameter allows you to specify a timezone for the schedule on the following objects:

- <PyObject object="schedule" decorator />
- <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" />
- <PyObject object="build_schedule_from_dbt_selection" module="dagster_dbt" />

This parameter accepts any [`tz` timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). For example, the following schedule will execute **every day at 9:00 AM in US Pacific time (America/Los_Angeles)**:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/schedules/schedules.py startafter=start_timezone endbefore=end_timezone
my_timezone_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=my_job, cron_schedule="0 9 * * *", execution_timezone="America/Los_Angeles"
)
```

---

## Setting timezones on partitioned jobs

Schedules constructed from partitioned jobs execute in the timezone defined on the partition's config. Partitions definitions have a `timezone` parameter, which accepts any [`tz` timezone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).

For example, the following partition uses the **US Pacific (America/Los_Angeles)** timezone:

```python file=concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/partition_with_timezone.py
from dagster import DailyPartitionsDefinition

daily_partition = DailyPartitionsDefinition(
    start_date="2024-05-20", timezone="America/Los_Angeles"
)
```

## Execution times and Daylight Savings Time

When Daylight Savings Time (DST) begins and ends, there may be some impact on your schedules' execution times.

### Impact on daily schedules

Because of DST transitions, it's possible to specify an execution time that doesn't exist for every scheduled interval.

Let's say you have a **schedule that executes every day at 2:30 AM.** On the day DST begins, time jumps from 2:00AM to 3:00AM, which means the time of 2:30 AM won't exist.

Dagster would instead run the schedule at the next time that exists, which would be 3:00 AM:

```markdown
# DST begins: time jumps forward an hour at 2:00 AM

- 12:30 AM
- 1:00 AM
- 1:30 AM
- 3:00 AM ## time transition; schedule executes
- 3:30 AM
- 4:00 AM
```

It's also possible to specify an execution time that exists twice on one day every year.

Let's say you have a **schedule that executes every day at 1:30 AM.** On the day DST ends, the hour from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM repeats, which means the time of 1:30 AM will exist twice. This means there are two possible times the schedule could run.

In this case, Dagster would execute the schedule at the second iteration of 1:30 AM:

```markdown
# DST ends: time jumps backward an hour at 2:00 AM

- 12:30 AM
- 1:00 AM
- 1:30 AM
- 1:00 AM ## time transition
- 1:30 AM ## schedule executes
- 2:00 AM
```

### Impact on hourly schedules

Hourly schedules are unaffected by daylight savings time transitions. Schedules will continue to run exactly once an hour, even as DST ends and the hour from 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM repeats.

Let's say you have a **schedule that executes hourly at 30 minutes past the hour.** On the day DST ends, the schedule would run at 12:30 AM and both instances of 1:30 AM before proceeding normally at 2:30 AM:

```markdown
# DST ends: time jumps backward an hour at 2:00 AM

- 12:30 AM ## schedule executes
- 1:00 AM
- 1:30 AM ## schedule executes
- 1:00 AM ## time transition
- 1:30 AM ## schedule executes
- 2:00 AM
- 2:30 AM ## schedule executes
```
