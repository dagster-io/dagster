# Declarative Automation

Dagster automatically tracks a large amount of information about events that impact the status of your assets, and the dependencies between them. Declarative Automation is a framework that lets you access this information to make intelligent decisions.

Pre-built conditions are provided to handle common use cases, such as executing on a periodic schedule or whenever an upstream dependency updates, but conditions can be customized in a fine-grained manner, allowing precise control over when work gets executed.

---

## Benefits

Using Declarative Automation helps you:

- Ensure you're working with the most up-to-date data
- Optimize resource usage by only materializing assets or executing checks when needed
- Precisely define when specific assets should be updated based on the state of other assets

---

## Prerequisites

Before continuing, you should be familiar with:

- [Asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets)
- [Sensor definitions](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors)
- [Code locations](/concepts/code-locations)

---

## How it works

Declarative Automation has two main components:

- **An automation condition (<PyObject object="AutomationCondition" />**), which represents when an individual asset or check should be executed.
- **A sensor (<PyObject object="AutomationConditionSensorDefinition" />**), which evaluates each <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> and launches runs in response to their status.

### Automation conditions

Automation conditions describe the conditions under which work should be executed. Dagster provides three pre-built conditions:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "25%",
        }}
      >
        Name
      </th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "40%",
        }}
      >
        Description
      </th>
      <th>Useful for</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.on_cron(cron_schedule)</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset on a provided cron schedule,
        after all of its dependencies have been updated
      </td>
      <td>
        Regularly updating an asset without worrying about the specifics of how
        its dependencies update
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.on_missing()</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset if all its dependencies have
        been updated, but the asset itself has not.
      </td>
      <td>
        Filling in partitioned assets as soon as upstream data is available.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>AutomationCondition.eager()</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        This condition will materialize an asset:
        <ul>
          <li>If the asset has never been materialized before, or</li>
          <li>
            When the asset's dependencies update, as long as none of the
            dependencies are currently missing or have an update in progress
          </li>
        </ul>
      </td>
      <td>
        <ul
          style={{
            marginTop: "0px",
          }}
        >
          <li
            style={{
              marginTop: "0px",
            }}
          >
            Automatically propagating changes through the asset graph
          </li>
          <li>Ensuring assets remain up-to-date</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

With assets, automation conditions can be set on the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator or on an <PyObject object="AssetSpec" />:

```python
import dagster as dg

@dg.asset(automation_condition=dg.AutomationCondition.eager())
def my_eager_asset(): ...

AssetSpec("my_cron_asset", automation_condition=AutomationCondition.on_cron("@daily"))
```

The same is true for asset checks:

```python
import dagster as dg

@dg.asset_check(asset=dg.AssetKey("orders"), automation_condition=dg.AutomationCondition.on_cron("@daily"))
def my_eager_check() -> dg.AssetCheckResult:
    return dg.AssetCheckResult(passed=True)


dg.AssetCheckSpec(
    "my_cron_check",
    asset=dg.AssetKey("orders"),
    automation_condition=dg.AutomationCondition.on_cron("@daily"),
)
```

The core <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> framework is extensible, allowing you to build conditions that fit specific needs. Refer to the [Customizing automation conditions guide](/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/customizing-automation-conditions) for more information.

### Sensors

When automation conditions for an asset or check are met, a sensor will execute a run in response. This sensor, named `default_automation_condition_sensor`, will be available for each code location and monitor all assets within that location. To use multiple sensors or change the properties of the default sensor, refer to the <PyObject object="AutomationConditionSensorDefinition" /> documentation.

For an automation condition sensor to run, it must be turned on and an active [`dagster-daemon` process](/deployment/dagster-daemon) must be running. If you used [`dagster dev` to start the Dagster UI/webserver](/guides/running-dagster-locally), the daemon process will be automatically launched alongside the webserver.

After these criteria are met, the sensor's evaluation history will be visible in the UI:

<!-- ![Default automation sensor evaluations in the Dagster UI](/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/default-automation-sensor.png) -->

<Image
alt="Default automation sensor evaluations in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/automation/declarative-automation/default-automation-sensor.png"
width={1898}
height={863}
/>

You'll also be able to view a detailed history of each asset's evaluations on the asset's [**Asset Details** page](/concepts/webserver/ui#asset-details). This allows you to see why an asset was or wasn't materialized at different points in time:

## Getting started

To use Declarative Automation, you'll need to enable the automation condition sensor in the Dagster UI:

1. Navigate to **Overview > Sensors**
2. Locate the desired code location.
3. In the code location, toggle the `default_automation_condition_sensor` sensor to on.

From here, you can:

- Define custom automation conditions
- View a history of each evaluation for the sensor
- Navigate to individual assets to see a history of their evaluations
