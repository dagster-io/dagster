description: Partitions break data into smaller chunks, allowing you to compute on individual slices of data while remaining flexible on how data is read or stored.

# Partitions

A Software-defined Asset can represent a collection of _partitions_ that can be tracked and materialized independently. In many ways, each partition functions like its own mini-asset, but they all share a common materialization function and dependencies. Typically, each partition will correspond to a separate file, or a slice of a table in a database.

Consider an online store's order data. In a database, the order data might be stored as a single `orders` table, which contains multiple days' worth of orders. However, if the data were ingested into Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 as parquet files, you could create a new parquet file per day or partition.

## Benefits

Using partitions provides the following benefits:

- **Cost efficiency**: Run only the data that’s needed and gain granular control over slices. For example, storing recent orders in hot storage and older orders in cheaper, cold storage.
- **Speed up compute**: Divide large datasets into smaller, more manageable parts to speed up queries.
- **Scalability**: As data grows, distribute it across multiple servers or storage systems or run multiple partitions at a time in parallel.
- **Concurrent processing**: Boost computational speed with parallel processing, significantly reducing the time and cost of data processing tasks.
- **Speed up debugging**: Test on an individual partition before trying to run larger ranges of data.

## Uses

Partitions are supported for both Software-defined Assets and ops, but how each concept is used is unique. Refer to the following documentation for more info:

- [Partitioned assets](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitioning-assets)
- [Partitioned ops](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitioning-ops) (Advanced)
- [Testing partitions](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/testing-partitions)

With partitions, you can:

- View runs by partition in the [Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui)
- Define a [schedule](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) that fills in a partition each time it runs. For example, a job might run each day and process the data that arrived during the previous day.
- Launch [backfills](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/backfills), which are sets of runs that each process a different partition. For example, after making a code change, you might want to run your job on all partitions instead of just one of them.
