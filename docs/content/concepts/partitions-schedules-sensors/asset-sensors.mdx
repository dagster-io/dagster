## Asset sensors

An asset sensor checks for new <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events for a particular asset key. This can be used to kick off a job that computes downstream assets or notifies appropriate stakeholders.

One benefit of this pattern is that it enables cross-job and even cross-repository dependencies. Each job run instigated by an asset sensor is agnostic to the job that caused it.

Dagster provides a special asset sensor definition format for sensors that fire a single <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> based on a single asset materialization. Here is an example of a sensor that generates a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> for every materialization for the asset key `my_table`:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_asset_sensor_marker endbefore=end_asset_sensor_marker
from dagster import AssetKey, EventLogEntry, SensorEvaluationContext, asset_sensor


@asset_sensor(asset_key=AssetKey("my_table"), job=my_job)
def my_asset_sensor(context: SensorEvaluationContext, asset_event: EventLogEntry):
    yield RunRequest(
        run_key=context.cursor,
        run_config={
            "ops": {
                "read_materialization": {
                    "config": {
                        "asset_key": asset_event.dagster_event.asset_key.path,
                    }
                }
            }
        },
    )
```

## Freshness policy sensors <Experimental />

A freshness policy sensor checks the freshness of a given selection of assets on each tick, and performs some action in response to that status.

The <PyObject object="FreshnessPolicySensorEvaluationContext" /> has a `current_minutes_late` property, specifying how many minutes late the asset is with respect to its <PyObject object="FreshnessPolicy" />, as well as `previous_minutes_late`, the number of minutes late that asset was on the previous sensor tick. Each tick, the decorated function will be run for each asset within the `asset_selection` that has a `FreshnessPolicy` defined.

Currently, freshness policy sensors do not support returning or yielding values (such as RunRequests) from their execution function.

Here is an example of a sensor that will send a single alert once an asset is 10 minutes later than its configured policy allows, and a single alert once that asset is on time again.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_freshness_policy_sensor_marker endbefore=end_freshness_policy_sensor_marker
from dagster import FreshnessPolicySensorEvaluationContext, freshness_policy_sensor


@freshness_policy_sensor(asset_selection=AssetSelection.all())
def my_freshness_alerting_sensor(context: FreshnessPolicySensorEvaluationContext):
    if context.current_minutes_late is None or context.previous_minutes_late is None:
        return

    if context.current_minutes_late >= 10 and context.previous_minutes_late < 10:
        send_alert(f"Asset with key {context.asset_key} is now more than 10 minutes late.")
    elif context.current_minutes_late == 0 and context.previous_minutes_late >= 10:
        send_alert(f"Asset with key {context.asset_key} is now on time.")
```

## Multi-asset sensors <Experimental />

### Triggering runs upon materializations

Multi-asset sensors, which can trigger job executions based on multiple asset materialization event streams, can be handled using the <PyObject object="multi_asset_sensor" decorator/> decorator.

In the body of the sensor, you have access to the materialization event records for each asset via the <PyObject object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext" /> context object. Methods within the context object will search for events after the [cursor](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors#sensor-optimizations-using-cursors).

- <PyObject
    object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
    method="latest_materialization_records_by_key"
  /> returns a dictionary mapping the asset key for each monitored asset to the most
  recent materialization record. If there is no materialization event, the mapped
  value will be none.
- <PyObject
    object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
    method="materialization_records_for_key"
  /> returns a list of materialization event records for a specified asset key.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_marker endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_marker
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("asset_a"), AssetKey("asset_b")],
    job=my_job,
)
def asset_a_and_b_sensor(context):
    asset_events = context.latest_materialization_records_by_key()
    if all(asset_events.values()):
        context.advance_all_cursors()
        return RunRequest()
```

Note the `context.advance_all_cursors` call near the end of the sensor. The cursor helps keep track of which materialization events have been processed by the sensor so that the next time the sensor runs, only newer events are fetched. Since `multi_asset_sensor`s provide flexibility to determine what conditions should result in `RunRequest`s, the sensor must manually update the cursor if a <PyObject object="RunRequest" /> is returned.

You can also return a <PyObject object="SkipReason" /> to document why the sensor didn't launch a run.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_w_skip_reason endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_w_skip_reason
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("asset_a"), AssetKey("asset_b")],
    job=my_job,
)
def asset_a_and_b_sensor_with_skip_reason(context):
    asset_events = context.latest_materialization_records_by_key()
    if all(asset_events.values()):
        context.advance_all_cursors()
        return RunRequest()
    elif any(asset_events.values()):
        materialized_asset_key_strs = [
            key.to_user_string() for key, value in asset_events.items() if value
        ]
        not_materialized_asset_key_strs = [
            key.to_user_string() for key, value in asset_events.items() if not value
        ]
        return SkipReason(
            f"Observed materializations for {materialized_asset_key_strs}, "
            f"but not for {not_materialized_asset_key_strs}"
        )
```

### Triggering runs upon partitioned materializations

You can use the <PyObject object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext" /> context object to fetch partitioned materializations for each monitored asset.

- <PyObject
    object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
    method="latest_materialization_records_by_partition"
  /> returns an mapping of partition key to the most recent materialization event
  record for that partition. Returns records in order by event ID.
- If all monitored assets have the same partitions definition, <PyObject
  object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
  method="latest_materialization_records_by_partition_and_asset"
  /> returns a mapping of each partition to a mapping of the most recent materialization record for that partition by asset key.

#### When all partitions have new materializations

The example below monitors two assets with the same daily partitions definition. Whenever both monitored assets have an unconsumed materialization for a given partition, the sensor kicks off a run for that partition.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_AND endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_AND
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"), AssetKey("upstream_daily_2")],
    job=downstream_daily_job,
)
def trigger_daily_asset_if_both_upstream_partitions_materialized(context):
    run_requests = []
    for (
        partition,
        materializations_by_asset,
    ) in context.latest_materialization_records_by_partition_and_asset().items():
        if set(materializations_by_asset.keys()) == set(context.asset_keys):
            run_requests.append(downstream_daily_job.run_request_for_partition(partition))
            for asset_key, materialization in materializations_by_asset.items():
                context.advance_cursor({asset_key: materialization})
    return run_requests
```

Notice the `context.advance_cursor` call marks specific materializations as consumed. In future context calls, these materializations will not be returned.

At the end of each tick, the cursor object evaluates the set of consumed materializations. For each monitored asset, the cursor automatically stores:

- `latest_consumed_event_id`, the ID of the newest materialization that was marked as consumed.
- `trailing_unconsumed_partitioned_event_ids`, the newest unconsumed event ID for up to 25 partitions of each asset. All of these events must be partitioned and older than the `latest_consumed_event_id` event for the asset.

The events in `trailing_unconsumed_partitioned_event_ids` will appear in future context calls until they are marked as consumed via a call to `advance_cursor`. A call to `advance_all_cursors` will also mark all existing events as consumed.

#### When any partitions have new materializations

The following example monitors two upstream daily-partitioned assets, kicking off materializations of the corresponding partition in the downstream daily-partitioned asset. After a partition has been materialized for both upstream assets, the downstream asset can then be materialized and the sensor kicks off a partitioned run. Thereafter, whenever either upstream partition has a new materialization, the sensor will yield a run request for the downstream asset.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_OR endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_OR
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"), AssetKey("upstream_daily_2")],
    job=downstream_daily_job,
)
def trigger_daily_asset_when_any_upstream_partitions_have_new_materializations(context):
    run_requests = []
    for (
        partition,
        materializations_by_asset,
    ) in context.latest_materialization_records_by_partition_and_asset().items():
        if all(
            [
                context.all_partitions_materialized(asset_key, [partition])
                for asset_key in context.asset_keys
            ]
        ):
            run_requests.append(downstream_daily_job.run_request_for_partition(partition))
            for asset_key, materialization in materializations_by_asset.items():
                if asset_key in context.asset_keys:
                    context.advance_cursor({asset_key: materialization})
    return run_requests
```

## Asset reconciliation sensor <Experimental />

Dagster provides an out-of-box sensor that will monitor a provided set of assets and automatically materialize them if they're "unreconciled". An asset is considered "unreconciled" if any of:

- The sensor has never tried to materialize it and it has never been materialized.
- Any of its parents have been materialized more recently than it has.
- Any of its parents are unreconciled.
- It is not up to date with respect to its FreshnessPolicy (see [Freshness-based scheduling](#freshness-based-scheduling-)).

The sensor materializes unreconciled assets and avoids materializing assets before their parents are reconciled.

You can create this sensor using the <PyObject object="build_asset_reconciliation_sensor"/> function. This sensor can help you keep your assets up-to-date without needing to write custom schedules or sensors for each asset. To use an asset reconciliation sensor, add it to your repository:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_reconciliation_sensor.py startafter=start_asset_reconciliation_sensor endbefore=end_asset_reconciliation_sensor
@repository
def repository_1():
    return [
        asset_a,
        asset_b,
        asset_c,
        build_asset_reconciliation_sensor(
            asset_selection=AssetSelection.assets(asset_b, asset_c),
            name="asset_reconciliation_sensor",
        ),
    ]
```

This sensor will materialize `asset_b` whenever any of its parents materialize, and it will materialize `asset_c` whenever any of its parents materialize.

### Freshness-based scheduling <Experimental />

Setting a `FreshnessPolicy` on an asset specifies how up-to-date the data in that asset is expected to be. The asset reconciliation sensor created using `build_asset_reconciliation_sensor` will kick off runs to keep that data in line with the defined policy.

As an example, if an asset has a `freshness_policy=FreshnessPolicy(maximum_lag_minutes=60)`, this specifies that, at any point in time, that asset should incoporate all upstream data from no more than an hour before that time. Manually setting up a schedule to do this would be fairly simple: simply kick off a job to update that asset along with all of its upstream assets once an hour. However, there are a few drawbacks to this approach.

First, this ignores updates that may be made outside the scheduled runs. If someone kicks off an ad-hoc run of an upstream asset, a sensor triggers an update, or another job runs some of the same assets, the static schedule will still recompute the contents of each selected asset even if it is no longer required to do so. Second, if multiple FreshnessPolicies are defined, it's likely that there will be a large degree of overlap in their dependencies. Setting up a schedule for each independent policy would be tedious, and result in a high degree of redundant work. Trying to eliminate this redundant work with a combination of custom schedules and asset sensors grows exponentially more difficult as the number of FreshnessPolicies increases.

Freshness-based scheduling offloads this complexity to the orchestrator, which can monitor the current state of all assets and plan runs to keep assets in line with their FreshnessPolicies. To minimize unnecessary computation, the sensor will take into account a few bits of information when determining if it needs to kick off a run for a given asset:

- A timestamp of the upstream data that is incorporated into the current state of the asset. This is calculated by finding the most recent materialization of that asset, then recursively finding the most recent materializations of its parents that happened before that event. The minimum timestamp found this way will be used as the current data time.
- Any in-progress runs that will update that asset in the near future. If an in-progress run will update an asset to an acceptable data time, then a new run will not be kicked off.
- The constraints specifying what upstream data must be incorporated into the state of an asset by certain times. If waiting some amount of time to kick off a materialization of an asset will allow multiple constraints to be satisfied at once, then the asset will not be materialized on that tick.

The sensor will only kick off runs for assets specified in the `asset_selection` argument of `build_asset_reconciliation_sensor`. If an asset in this selection is downstream of an asset outside of the selection, the sensor will not kick off a run of the selected asset until a materialization event for the upstream asset is created.
