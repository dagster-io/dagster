## Asset sensors

A useful pattern is to create a sensor that checks for new <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events for a particular asset key. This can be used to kick off a job that computes downstream assets or notifies appropriate stakeholders.

One benefit of this pattern is that it enables cross-job and even cross-repository dependencies. Each job run instigated by an asset sensor is agnostic to the job that caused it.

Dagster provides a special asset sensor definition format for sensors that fire a single <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> based on a single asset materialization. Here is an example of a sensor that generates a <PyObject object="RunRequest"/> for every materialization for the asset key `my_table`:

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_asset_sensor_marker endbefore=end_asset_sensor_marker
from dagster import AssetKey, EventLogEntry, SensorEvaluationContext, asset_sensor


@asset_sensor(asset_key=AssetKey("my_table"), job=my_job)
def my_asset_sensor(context: SensorEvaluationContext, asset_event: EventLogEntry):
    yield RunRequest(
        run_key=context.cursor,
        run_config={
            "ops": {
                "read_materialization": {
                    "config": {
                        "asset_key": asset_event.dagster_event.asset_key.path,
                    }
                }
            }
        },
    )
```

## Multi-asset sensors <Experimental />

### Triggering runs upon materializations

Multi-asset sensors, which can trigger job executions based on multiple asset materialization event streams, can be handled using the <PyObject object="multi_asset_sensor" decorator/> decorator.

In the body of the sensor, you have access to the materialization event records for each asset via the <PyObject object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext" /> context object. Methods within the context object will search for events after the [cursor](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors#sensor-optimizations-using-cursors).

- <PyObject
  object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
  method="latest_materialization_records_by_key"
  /> returns a dictionary mapping the asset key for each monitored asset to the most
  recent materialization record. If there is no materialization event, the mapped
  value will be none.
- <PyObject
  object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
  method="materialization_records_for_key"
  /> returns a list of materialization event records for a specified asset key.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_marker endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_marker
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("asset_a"), AssetKey("asset_b")],
    job=my_job,
)
def asset_a_and_b_sensor(context):
    asset_events = context.latest_materialization_records_by_key()
    if all(asset_events.values()):
        context.advance_all_cursors()
        return RunRequest()
```

Note the `context.advance_all_cursors` call near the end of the sensor. The cursor helps keep track of which materialization events have been processed by the sensor so that the next time the sensor runs, only newer events are fetched. Since `multi_asset_sensor`s provide flexibility to determine what conditions should result in `RunRequest`s, the sensor must manually update the cursor if a <PyObject object="RunRequest" /> is returned.

You can also return a <PyObject object="SkipReason" /> to document why the sensor didn't launch a run.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_w_skip_reason endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_w_skip_reason
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("asset_a"), AssetKey("asset_b")],
    job=my_job,
)
def asset_a_and_b_sensor_with_skip_reason(context):
    asset_events = context.latest_materialization_records_by_key()
    if all(asset_events.values()):
        context.advance_all_cursors()
        return RunRequest()
    elif any(asset_events.values()):
        materialized_asset_key_strs = [
            key.to_user_string() for key, value in asset_events.items() if value
        ]
        not_materialized_asset_key_strs = [
            key.to_user_string() for key, value in asset_events.items() if not value
        ]
        return SkipReason(
            f"Observed materializations for {materialized_asset_key_strs}, "
            f"but not for {not_materialized_asset_key_strs}"
        )
```

### Triggering runs upon partitioned materializations

You can use the <PyObject object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext" /> context object to fetch partitioned materializations for each monitored asset.

- <PyObject
  object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
  method="latest_materialization_records_by_partition"
  /> returns an mapping of partition key to the most recent materialization event
  record for that partition. Returns records in order by event ID.
- If all monitored assets have the same partitions definition, <PyObject
  object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
  method="latest_materialization_records_by_partition_and_asset"
  /> returns a mapping of each partition to a mapping of the most recent materialization record for that partition by asset key.

#### When all partitions have new materializations

The example below monitors two assets with the same daily partitions definition. Whenever both monitored assets have an unconsumed materialization for a given partition, the sensor kicks off a run for that partition.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_AND endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_AND
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"), AssetKey("upstream_daily_2")],
    job=downstream_daily_job,
)
def trigger_daily_asset_if_both_upstream_partitions_materialized(context):
    run_requests = []
    for (
        partition,
        materializations_by_asset,
    ) in context.latest_materialization_records_by_partition_and_asset().items():
        if set(materializations_by_asset.keys()) == set(context.asset_keys):
            run_requests.append(
                downstream_daily_job.run_request_for_partition(partition)
            )
            for asset_key, materialization in materializations_by_asset.items():
                context.advance_cursor({asset_key: materialization})
    return run_requests
```

Notice the `context.advance_cursor` call marks specific materializations as consumed. In future context calls, these materializations will not be returned.

At the end of each tick, the cursor object evaluates the set of consumed materializations. For each monitored asset, the cursor automatically stores:

- `latest_consumed_event_id`, the ID of the newest materialization that was marked as consumed.
- `trailing_unconsumed_partitioned_event_ids`, the newest unconsumed event ID for up to 25 partitions of each asset. All of these events must be partitioned and older than the `latest_consumed_event_id` event for the asset.

The events in `trailing_unconsumed_partitioned_event_ids` will appear in future context calls until they are marked as consumed via a call to `advance_cursor`. A call to `advance_all_cursors` will also mark all existing events as consumed.

#### When any partitions are replaced

The following example monitors two upstream daily-partitioned assets, kicking off materializations of the corresponding partition in the downstream daily-partitioned asset. After a partition has been materialized for both upstream assets, the downstream asset can then be materialized and the sensor kicks off a partitioned run. Replacing either upstream partition thereafter will yield a run request for the downstream asset.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_multi_asset_sensor_OR endbefore=end_multi_asset_sensor_OR
@multi_asset_sensor(
    asset_keys=[AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"), AssetKey("upstream_daily_2")],
    job=downstream_daily_job,
)
def trigger_daily_asset_when_any_upstream_partitions_replaced(context):
    run_requests = []
    for (
        partition,
        materializations_by_asset,
    ) in context.latest_materialization_records_by_partition_and_asset().items():
        if all(
            [
                context.all_partitions_materialized(asset_key, [partition])
                for asset_key in context.asset_keys
            ]
        ):
            run_requests.append(
                downstream_daily_job.run_request_for_partition(partition)
            )
            for asset_key, materialization in materializations_by_asset.items():
                if asset_key in context.asset_keys:
                    context.advance_cursor({asset_key: materialization})
    return run_requests
```

If the <PyObject object="PartitionsDefinition"/> of the monitored assets differs from the triggered asset, you can use the <PyObject object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext" method="get_downstream_partition_keys"/> method to map a partition key from one asset to another. This method accepts a partition key from the upstream asset and uses the existing <PyObject object="PartitionMapping"/> object on the downstream asset to fetch the corresponding partitions in the downstream asset.

If a partition mapping is not defined, Dagster will use the default partition mapping, which is the <PyObject object="TimeWindowPartitionMapping"/> for time window partitions definitions and the <PyObject object="IdentityPartitionMapping"/> for other partitions definitions. The <PyObject object="TimeWindowPartitionMapping"/> will map an upstream partition to the downstream partitions that overlap with it.

## Examples

### Monitoring daily assets to materialize a weekly asset

The following code example monitors an upstream daily-partitioned asset, kicking off materializations of a downstream weekly-partitioned asset whenever a daily partition is materialized and all daily partitions in the week have existing materializations. Every time a daily partition is replaced, the weekly partition will materialize.

<PyObject
object="MultiAssetSensorEvaluationContext"
method="all_partitions_materialized"
/> is a utility method accepts a list of partitions and checks if every provided
partition has been materialized. This method ignores the cursor, so it searches through
all existing materializations.

```python file=/concepts/partitions_schedules_sensors/sensors/asset_sensors.py startafter=start_daily_asset_to_weekly_asset endbefore=end_daily_asset_to_weekly_asset
@multi_asset_sensor(asset_keys=[AssetKey("upstream_daily_1")], job=weekly_asset_job)
def trigger_weekly_asset_from_daily_asset(context):
    run_requests_by_partition = {}
    materializations_by_partition = context.latest_materialization_records_by_partition(
        AssetKey("upstream_daily_1")
    )

    # Get all corresponding weekly partitions for any materialized daily partitions
    for partition, materialization in materializations_by_partition.items():
        weekly_partitions = context.get_downstream_partition_keys(
            partition,
            from_asset_key=AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"),
            to_asset_key=AssetKey("downstream_weekly_asset"),
        )

        if weekly_partitions:  # Check that a downstream weekly partition exists
            # Upstream daily partition can only map to at most one downstream weekly partition
            daily_partitions_in_week = context.get_downstream_partition_keys(
                weekly_partitions[0],
                from_asset_key=AssetKey("downstream_weekly_asset"),
                to_asset_key=AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"),
            )
            if context.all_partitions_materialized(
                AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"), daily_partitions_in_week
            ):
                run_requests_by_partition[
                    weekly_partitions[0]
                ] = weekly_asset_job.run_request_for_partition(weekly_partitions[0])
                # Advance the cursor so we only check event log records past the cursor
                context.advance_cursor({AssetKey("upstream_daily_1"): materialization})
    return list(run_requests_by_partition.values())
```
