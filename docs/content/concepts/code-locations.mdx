# Code locations

<Note>
  Before the introduction of the <PyObject object="Definitions" />
  API, definitions were grouped into repositories, and there could be many repostories
  in a particular code location. Refer to the <a href="/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories">
    Repositories documentation
  </a> for info on this previous API and mental model.
</Note>

A code location is a collection of Dagster definitions loadable and accessible by Dagster's tools, such as the CLI, UI, and Dagster+. A code location comprises:

- A reference to a Python module that has an instance of <PyObject object="Definitions" /> in a top-level variable
- A Python environment that can successfully load that module

Definitions within a code location have a common namespace and must have unique names. This allows them to be grouped and organized by code location in tools.

A single deployment can have one or multiple code locations.

Code locations are loaded in a different process and communicate with Dagster system processes over an RPC mechanism. This architecture provides several advantages:

- When there is an update to user code, the Dagster webserver/UI can pick up the change without a restart.
- You can use multiple code locations to organize jobs, but still work on all of your code locations using a single instance of the webserver/UI.
- The Dagster webserver process can run in a separate Python environment from user code so job dependencies don't need to be installed into the webserver environment.
- Each code location can be sourced from a separate Python environment, so teams can manage their dependencies (or even their Python versions) separately.

| Name                              | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject object="Definitions" /> | The object that contains all the definitions defined within a code location. Definitions include assets, jobs, resources, schedules, and sensors. |

---

## Defining code locations

To define a code location, create a top-level variable that contains a <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object in a Python module. For example:

```python
# definitions.py

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[dbt_customers_asset, dbt_orders_asset],
    schedules=[bi_weekly_schedule],
    sensors=[new_data_sensor],
    resources=[dbt_resource],
)
```

It is recommenced to include definitions in a Python module named `definitions.py`.

## Deploying and loading code locations

- [Local development](#local-development)
- [Dagster+ deployment](#dagster-deployment)
- [Open source deployment](#open-source-deployment)

### Local development

<!-- Lives in /next/components/mdx/includes/dagster/DagsterDevTabs.mdx -->

<DagsterDevTabs />

Refer to the [Running Dagster locally guide](/guides/running-dagster-locally) for more info about local development, including how to configure your local instance.

### Dagster+ deployment

The [`dagster_cloud.yaml`](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) file is used to create and deploy code locations for Dagster+ deployments. Each code location entry in this file has a `code_source` property, which is used to specify how a code location is sourced. Code locations can be sourced from a Python file or module:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Using a Python file">

To load a code location from a Python file, use the `python_file` property in your `dagster_cloud.yaml`:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my-code-location
    code_source:
      python_file: my_file.py
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using a Python module">

To load a code location from a Python module, use the `module_name` property in your `dagster_cloud.yaml`:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my-code-location
    code_source:
      module_name: my_module_name.definitions
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Open source deployment

The `workspace.yaml` file is used to load code locations for open source (OSS) deployments. This file specifies how to load a collection of code locations and is typically used in advanced use cases. Refer to the [Workspace files page](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files) for more info.

## Definitions versus repositories

If you used <PyObject object="repository" decorator /> in previous Dagster versions, you might be interested in how `Definitions` and repositories differ. Check out the following table for a high-level comparison:
