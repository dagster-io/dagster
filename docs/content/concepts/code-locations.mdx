# Code Locations

A code location is collection of Dagster definitions loadable and accessible by Dagster's tools, such as the CLI, Dagit, and Dagster Cloud. A code location comprises:

- A reference to a python module or package that has an instance of `Definitions` at the "defs" variable.
- A Python environment that can successfully load that module or package.

Definitions within a code location have a common namespace and must have unique names. This allows them to be grouped and organized by code location in tools.

<Note>
  Before the introduction of the <PyObject object="Definitions" />
  API, definitions were grouped into repositories, and there could be many repostories
  in a particular code location. See the <a href="/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories">
    {" "}
    guide{" "}
  </a> on Repositories for this previous API and mental model.

<!-- Introduction
	Make sure to include:

	- What the concept is
	- What it does
	- When to use it
	- How it ties into a Dagster project overall

	For example: https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops#ops
	Ops includes the what, when, why, and a nifty diagram. Diagrams are huge for users.

## Deploying And Loading Code Locations

<!-- See example: https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops#defining-an-op

	This section outlines the 'how' part of applying the concept in code
	Currently our docs go between the basics and some more complex use cases, but
	I'd opt for going simple here and getting more complex in the Examples section

	Additionally, if this concept will be surfaced in Dagit, consider covering that. Ex: Describe
	how to navigate to viewing the relevant page in Dagit.
-->

To define a code location, one first has to create a <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object in the `defs` variable of a python module. This can be is vanilla python file (e.g. `foo.py`). In that case the <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object can go in that file itself. Or it can be an installed python package in which case the definitions object should be defined in the `defs` symbol in that package's top-level `__init__.py` file.

```python
defs = Definitions(
    assets=[an_asset, another_asset],
    schedules=[a_schedule],
    sensors=[a_sensor],
    resources=some_resources
)
```

<TabGroup>
    <TabItem name="Local Development">

`dagit` and other Dagster tools can load a file directly as a code location. The command `dagit -f foo.py` is loading a code location: it will load the definitions in `foo.py` as a code location in the same python environment where Dagit resides.

Installed python packages can also be loaded directly. For Dagster projects deployed to production we recommend this style of development, as it eliminates an entire class of python import errors. Create a Dagster project with the `dagster project scaffold` command or by using one of our templates. This project can then be installed using `pip install -e .` to make it an editable install for local development.

Once installed, this package can be loaded typing `dagit -m your_package_name`. This should be read as "load definitions in the `defs` symbol in this package (defined as its root `__init__.py` file) in the same virtual environment as Dagit itself.

Our project templates also create a `pyproject.toml` file with a `tool.dagster` section an assignment to the `python_package` variable in that section. This allows users to type just `dagit` without any parameters and the package name is defined in that variable. This is very convenient for local development.

    [tool.dagster]
    python_package = "your_package_name"

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Cloud Deployment">

In cloud, instructions for creating and deploying code locations are specified in the `dagster_cloud.yaml` file. TODO: insert link to dagster_cloud.yaml page here.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="OSS Deployment">

OSS deployment uses the workspace.yaml file to load code locations. A workspace file specifies how to load a collection of code locations and is used in advanced use cases. See particular guides for how to do that.

## Examples

<!-- Common use cases and other more complex examples, each separated by a heading.
	Examples should also include an explanation of what the code is doing / why
	it's done this way. Link to other docs where pertinent.

## Troubleshooting

<!-- Common issues or error messages specific to the concept.

	See example: https://docs.dagster.io/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets#troubleshooting
	While not a concept page, this guide ^ demonstrates how to interpret errors + resolve issues

	The table used in that guide:
<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "30%",
        }}
      >
        Error
      </th>
      <th>Description and resolution</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>[ERROR]</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        Description of the error and how to resolve it
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

	Headings can be used if an error isn't surfaced, or if a table will make readability difficult. Ex:

### Brief-description-of-issue

Describe when/why this happens and how to fix it. Include code examples if needed.
