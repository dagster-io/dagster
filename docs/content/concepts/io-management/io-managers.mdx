# I/O managers

<Note>
  This guide covers using the new Pythonic resources system introduced in
  Dagster 1.3. If your code is still using the legacy resources system, see the{" "}
  <a href="/concepts/io-management/io-managers-legacy">
    legacy I/O managers guide
  </a>
  . To migrate your code, refer to the <a href="/guides/dagster/migrating-to-pythonic-resources-and-config">
    migrating to Pythonic resources and config
  </a> guide.
</Note>

I/O managers are user-provided objects that store asset and op outputs and load them as inputs to downstream assets and ops. They can be a powerful tool that reduces boilerplate code and easily changes where your data is stored.

Functions decorated by <PyObject object="asset" decorator/>, <PyObject object="multi_asset" decorator/>, and <PyObject object="op" decorator/> can return values that are written to persistent storage. Downstream assets and ops can have parameters that load the values from persistent storage. <PyObject module="dagster" object="IOManager" pluralize /> let the user control how this data is stored and how it's loaded in downstream ops and assets. For `@asset` and `@multi_asset`, the I/O manager effectively determines where the physical asset lives.

</center>

The I/O manager APIs make it easy to separate code that's responsible for logical data transformation from code that's responsible for reading and writing the results. Asset definitions and ops can focus on business logic, while I/O managers handle I/O. This separation makes it easier to test the business logic and run it in different environments.

For non-asset jobs with inputs that aren't connected to upstream outputs, see the [Unconnected Inputs](/concepts/io-management/unconnected-inputs) overview.

## Basics

- [When to use I/O managers](#when-to-use-io-managers)
- [Outputs and downstream inputs](#outputs-and-downstream-inputs)
- [Built-in I/O managers](#built-in-io-managers)
- [I/O managers are resources](#io-managers-are-resources)

### When to use I/O managers

If you find yourself writing the same code at the start and end of each asset or op to load and store data, you may want to consider factoring that code into an I/O manager. They can be useful in situations where:

- Many assets are stored in the same location and follow a consistent set of rules to determine the storage path
- Assets should be stored differently in local, staging, and production environments
- Asset functions load the upstream dependencies into memory to do the computation

However, I/O managers are not required, nor are they the best option in all scenarios. For example, an asset that executes a Snowflake query to create a new table based on the data of another table. This asset would depend on the existing table, but doesn't need to load that table in memory in order to execute the query:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/no_io_assets_examples.py startafter=start_snowflake_example endbefore=end_snowflake_example
@asset(deps=[orders])
def returns():
    conn = get_snowflake_connection()
    conn.execute(
        "CREATE TABLE returns AS SELECT * from orders WHERE status = 'RETURNED'"
    )
```

Other reasons you may not want to use I/O managers:

- You want to run a SQL query that creates or updates a table in a database (the above example).
- Your pipeline manages I/O on its own by using other libraries/tools that write to storage.
- You have unique and custom storage requirements for each asset.
- Your assets won't fit in memory (for example, a database table with billions of rows).
- You have an existing pipeline that manages its own I/O and want to run it with Dagster with minimal code changes.
- You simply prefer to have the reading and writing code explicitly defined in each asset.

As a general rule, if your pipeline becomes more complicated in order to use I/O managers, or you find yourself getting confused when implementing I/O managers, it's likely that you are in a situation where I/O managers are **not** a good fit. In these cases you should use [`deps`](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-basic-dependencies) to define dependencies.

### Outputs and downstream inputs

<PyObject module="dagster" object="IOManager" pluralize /> are user-provided objects
that are responsible for storing the output of an asset or op and loading it as input
to downstream assets or ops. For example, an I/O manager might store and load objects
from files on a filesystem.

Each asset definition can have its own I/O manager. In the [multi-asset](/concepts/assets/multi-assets) case where multiple assets are outputted, each outputted asset can be handled with a different I/O manager:

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Multi-asset with each outputted asset being handled by a different I/O
  manager"
    src="/images/concepts/multi-asset-io-manager.png"
    width={623}
    height={410}
  />
</center>

For ops, each op output can have its own I/O manager, or multiple op outputs can share an I/O manager. The I/O manager that's used for handling a particular op output is automatically used for loading it in downstream ops.

Consider the following diagram. In this example, a job has two I/O managers, each of which is shared across a few inputs and outputs:

<center>
  <Image src="/images/concepts/two-io-managers.png" width={643} height={382} />
</center>

### Built-in I/O managers

The default I/O manager, <PyObject module="dagster" object="FilesystemIOManager" />, stores and retrieves values from pickle files in the local filesystem. If a job is invoked via <PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process" />, the default I/O manager is switched to <PyObject module="dagster" object="mem_io_manager"/>, which stores outputs in memory.

Dagster provides out-of-the-box I/O managers for popular storage systems, such as Amazon S3 and Snowflake, or you can write your own:

- From scratch, or
- By extending the `UPathIOManager` if you want to store data in an `fsspec`-supported filesystem

For a full list of Dagster-provided I/O managers, refer to the [built-in I/O managers list](#built-in-io-managers-1).

### I/O managers are resources

I/O managers are provided through the [resources](/concepts/resources) system, which means you can supply different I/O managers for the same assets or ops in different situations. For example, you might use an in-memory I/O manager for unit-testing and an Amazon S3 I/O manager in production.

---

## Using I/O managers with asset definitions

### Applying I/O managers to assets

By default, materializing an asset named `my_asset` will pickle it to a local file named `my_asset`. The directory that file lives underneath is determined by the rules in <PyObject object="FilesytemIOManager" />.

[I/O managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) enable fully overriding this behavior and storing asset contents in any way you wish - e.g. writing them as tables in a database or as objects in a cloud object store such as s3. You can use one of Dagster's [built-in I/O managers](#built-in-io-managers), or you can write your own.

To apply an I/O manager to a set of assets, you can use <PyObject object="Definitions" />:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_io_manager.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster_aws.s3 import S3PickleIOManager, S3Resource

from dagster import Definitions, asset


@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[upstream_asset, downstream_asset],
    resources={
        "io_manager": S3PickleIOManager(
            s3_resource=S3Resource(), s3_bucket="my-bucket"
        ),
    },
)
```

This example also constructs an <PyObject module="dagster_aws.s3" object="S3Resource" /> because the <PyObject module="dagster_aws.s3" object="S3PickleIOManager" /> depends on the S3 resource. For more information on how these resource-resource dependencies are modeled, refer to the [resources](/concepts/resources#resources-that-depend-on-other-resources) documentation.

When `upstream_asset` is materialized, the value `[1, 2, 3]` will be pickled and stored in an object on S3. When `downstream_asset` is materialized, the value of `upstream_asset` will be read from S3 and depickled, and `[1, 2, 3, 4]` will be pickled and stored in a different object on S3.

### Per-asset I/O manager

Different assets can have different I/O managers:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_different_io_managers.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster_aws.s3 import S3PickleIOManager, S3Resource

from dagster import Definitions, FilesystemIOManager, asset


@asset(io_manager_key="s3_io_manager")
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset(io_manager_key="fs_io_manager")
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[upstream_asset, downstream_asset],
    resources={
        "s3_io_manager": S3PickleIOManager(
            s3_resource=S3Resource(), s3_bucket="my-bucket"
        ),
        "fs_io_manager": FilesystemIOManager(),
    },
)
```

When `upstream_asset` is materialized, the value `[1, 2, 3]` will be pickled and stored in an object on S3. When `downstream_asset` is materialized, the value of `upstream_asset` will be read from S3 and depickled, and `[1, 2, 3, 4]` will be pickled and stored in a file on the local filesystem.

In the multi-asset case, you can customize how each asset is materialized by specifying an `io_manager_key` on each output of the multi-asset.

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_assets.py startafter=start_io_manager_multi_asset endbefore=end_io_manager_multi_asset
from dagster import AssetOut, multi_asset


@multi_asset(
    outs={
        "s3_asset": AssetOut(io_manager_key="s3_io_manager"),
        "adls_asset": AssetOut(io_manager_key="adls2_io_manager"),
    },
)
def my_assets():
    return "store_me_on_s3", "store_me_on_adls2"
```

The same assets can be bound to different resources and I/O managers in different environments. For example, for local development, you might want to store assets on your local filesystem while in production, you might want to store the assets in S3.

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_io_manager_prod_local.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
import os

from dagster_aws.s3 import S3PickleIOManager, S3Resource

from dagster import Definitions, FilesystemIOManager, asset


@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]


resources_by_env = {
    "prod": {
        "io_manager": S3PickleIOManager(s3_resource=S3Resource(), s3_bucket="my-bucket")
    },
    "local": {"io_manager": FilesystemIOManager()},
}

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[upstream_asset, downstream_asset],
    resources=resources_by_env[os.getenv("ENV", "local")],
)
```

### Using I/O managers to load source data

Asset definitions often depend on data assets that are generated outside of Dagster, or in a different code location within Dagster, and it's often useful to use I/O managers to load the data from these assets. You can use an <PyObject object="AssetSpec" /> to define an asset with no materialization function, and you can assign an I/O manager to it using the <PyObject object="AssetSpec" method="with_io_manager_key" /> method. Your other assets can then depend on it and load data from it, just as they would with a materializable asset.

For example:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/source_asset.py
from dagster import AssetKey, AssetSpec, Definitions, asset

my_source_asset = AssetSpec(key=AssetKey("my_source_asset")).with_io_manager_key(
    "s3_io_manager"
)


@asset
def my_derived_asset(my_source_asset):
    return my_source_asset + [4]


defs = Definitions(assets=[my_source_asset, my_derived_asset])
```

### Asset input I/O managers

In some cases you may need to load the input to an asset with different logic than that specified by the upstream asset's I/O manager.

To set an I/O manager for a particular input, use the `input_manager_key` argument on <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetIn" />.

In this example,`first_asset` and `second_asset` will be stored using the default I/O manager, but will be loaded as inputs to `third_asset` using the logic defined in the `PandasSeriesIOManager` (in this case loading as Pandas Series rather than Python lists).

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_input_managers.py startafter=start_different_input_managers endbefore=end_different_input_managers
@asset
def first_asset() -> List[int]:
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset
def second_asset() -> List[int]:
    return [4, 5, 6]


@asset(
    ins={
        "first_asset": AssetIn(input_manager_key="pandas_series"),
        "second_asset": AssetIn(input_manager_key="pandas_series"),
    }
)
def third_asset(first_asset: pd.Series, second_asset: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    return pd.concat([first_asset, second_asset, pd.Series([7, 8])])


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[first_asset, second_asset, third_asset],
    resources={
        "pandas_series": PandasSeriesIOManager(),
    },
)
```

## Using I/O managers with non-asset jobs

### Job-wide I/O manager

By default, all the inputs and outputs in a job use the same I/O manager. This I/O manager is determined by the <PyObject module="dagster" object="ResourceDefinition" /> provided for the `"io_manager"` resource key. `"io_manager"` is a resource key that Dagster reserves specifically for this purpose.

Here’s how to specify that all op outputs are stored using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="FilesystemIOManager" />, which pickles outputs and stores them on the local filesystem. It stores files in a directory with the run ID in the path, so that outputs from prior runs will never be overwritten.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/default_io_manager.py
from dagster import FilesystemIOManager, job, op


@op
def op_1():
    return 1


@op
def op_2(a):
    return a + 1


@job(resource_defs={"io_manager": FilesystemIOManager()})
def my_job():
    op_2(op_1())
```

### Per-output I/O manager

Not all the outputs in a job should necessarily be stored the same way. Maybe some of the outputs should live on the filesystem so they can be inspected, and others can be transiently stored in memory.

To select the I/O manager for a particular output, you can set an `io_manager_key` on <PyObject module="dagster" object="Out" />, and then refer to that `io_manager_key` when setting I/O managers in your job. In this example, the output of `op_1` will go to `FilesystemIOManager` and the output of `op_2` will go to `S3PickleIOManager`.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/io_manager_per_output.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster_aws.s3 import S3PickleIOManager, S3Resource

from dagster import FilesystemIOManager, Out, job, op


@op(out=Out(io_manager_key="fs"))
def op_1():
    return 1


@op(out=Out(io_manager_key="s3_io"))
def op_2(a):
    return a + 1


@job(
    resource_defs={
        "fs": FilesystemIOManager(),
        "s3_io": S3PickleIOManager(s3_resource=S3Resource(), s3_bucket="test-bucket"),
    }
)
def my_job():
    op_2(op_1())
```

### Per-input I/O manager

Just as with the inputs to assets, the inputs to ops can be loaded using custom logic if you want to override the I/O manager of the upstream output. To set an I/O manager for a particular input, use the `input_manager_key` argument on <PyObject module="dagster" object="In" />.

In this example, the output of `op_1` will be stored using the default I/O manager, but will be loaded in `op_2` using the logic defined in the `PandasSeriesIOManager` (in this case loading as Pandas Series rather than python lists).

```python file=/concepts/io_management/input_managers.py startafter=start_different_input_managers endbefore=end_different_input_managers
@op
def op_1():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@op(ins={"a": In(input_manager_key="pandas_series")})
def op_2(a):
    return pd.concat([a, pd.Series([4, 5, 6])])


@job(resource_defs={"pandas_series": pd_series_io_manager})
def a_job():
    op_2(op_1())
```

## Defining an I/O manager

If you have specific requirements for where and how your outputs should be stored and retrieved, you can define your own I/O manager. This boils down to implementing two functions: one that stores outputs and one that loads inputs.

To define an I/O manager, extend the <PyObject module="dagster" object="IOManager" /> class. Oftentimes, you will want to extend the <PyObject module="dagster" object="ConfigurableIOManager"/> class (which subclasses `IOManager`) to attach a config schema to your I/O manager.

Here, we define a simple I/O manager that reads and writes CSV values to the filesystem. It takes an optional prefix path through config.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/custom_io_manager.py startafter=start_io_manager_marker endbefore=end_io_manager_marker
from dagster import ConfigurableIOManager, InputContext, OutputContext


class MyIOManager(ConfigurableIOManager):
    # specifies an optional string list input, via config system
    path_prefix: List[str] = []

    def _get_path(self, context) -> str:
        return "/".join(self.path_prefix + context.asset_key.path)

    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        write_csv(self._get_path(context), obj)

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        return read_csv(self._get_path(context))
```

The provided `context` argument for `handle_output` is an <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputContext" />. The provided `context` argument for `load_input` is an <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputContext" />. The linked API documentation lists all the fields that are available on these objects.

### Using an I/O manager factory

If your I/O manager is more complex, or needs to manage internal state, it may make sense to split out the I/O manager definition from its configuration. In this case, you can use <PyObject object="ConfigurableIOManagerFactory"/>, which specifies config schema and implements a factory function that takes the config and returns an I/O manager.

In this case, we implement a stateful I/O manager which maintains a cache.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/custom_io_manager.py startafter=start_io_manager_factory_marker endbefore=end_io_manager_factory_marker
from dagster import IOManager, ConfigurableIOManagerFactory, OutputContext, InputContext
import requests


class ExternalIOManager(IOManager):
    def __init__(self, api_token):
        self._api_token = api_token
        # setup stateful cache
        self._cache = {}

    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj): ...

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        if context.asset_key in self._cache:
            return self._cache[context.asset_key]
        ...


class ConfigurableExternalIOManager(ConfigurableIOManagerFactory):
    api_token: str

    def create_io_manager(self, context) -> ExternalIOManager:
        return ExternalIOManager(self.api_token)
```

### Defining Pythonic I/O managers

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> This section applies to Dagster 1.3 and later.
  Refer to the <a href="/concepts/resources">Resources</a> documentation for
  more info on Pythonic resources.
</Note>

Pythonic I/O managers are defined as subclasses of <PyObject object="ConfigurableIOManager"/>, and similarly to [Pythonic resources](/concepts/resources) specify any configuration fields as attributes. Each subclass must implement a `handle_output` and `load_input` method, which are called by Dagster at runtime to handle the storing and loading of data.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_io_manager endbefore=end_new_io_manager dedent=4
from dagster import (
    Definitions,
    AssetKey,
    OutputContext,
    InputContext,
    ConfigurableIOManager,
)

class MyIOManager(ConfigurableIOManager):
    root_path: str

    def _get_path(self, asset_key: AssetKey) -> str:
        return self.root_path + "/".join(asset_key.path)

    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        write_csv(self._get_path(context.asset_key), obj)

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        return read_csv(self._get_path(context.asset_key))

defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={"io_manager": MyIOManager(root_path="/tmp/")},
)
```

### Handling partitioned assets

I/O managers can be written to handle [partitioned](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/partitions) assets. For a partitioned asset, each invocation of `handle_output` will (over)write a single partition, and each invocation of `load_input` will load one or more partitions. When the I/O manager is backed by a filesystem or object store, then each partition will typically correspond to a file or object. When it's backed by a database, then each partition will typically correspond to a range of rows in a table that fall within a particular window.

The default I/O manager has support for loading a partitioned upstream asset for a downstream asset with matching partitions out of the box (see the section below for loading multiple partitions). The <PyObject module="dagster" object="UPathIOManager" /> can be used to handle partitions in custom filesystem-based I/O managers.

To handle partitions in an custom I/O manager, you'll need to determine which partition you're dealing with when you're storing an output or loading an input. For this, <PyObject object="OutputContext" /> and <PyObject object="InputContext" /> have a `asset_partition_key` property:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/custom_io_manager.py startafter=start_partitioned_marker endbefore=end_partitioned_marker
class MyPartitionedIOManager(IOManager):
    def _get_path(self, context) -> str:
        if context.has_partition_key:
            return "/".join(context.asset_key.path + [context.asset_partition_key])
        else:
            return "/".join(context.asset_key.path)

    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        write_csv(self._get_path(context), obj)

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        return read_csv(self._get_path(context))
```

If you're working with time window partitions, you can also use the `asset_partitions_time_window` property, which will return a <PyObject object="TimeWindow" /> object.

#### Handling partition mappings

A single partition of one asset might depend on a range of partitions of an upstream asset.

The default I/O manager has support for loading multiple upstream partitions. In this case, the downstream asset should use `Dict[str, ...]` (or leave it blank) type for the upstream `DagsterType`. Here is an example of loading multiple upstream partitions using the default partition mapping:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/loading_multiple_upstream_partitions.py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Dict

import pandas as pd

from dagster import (
    AssetExecutionContext,
    DailyPartitionsDefinition,
    HourlyPartitionsDefinition,
    asset,
    materialize,
)

start = datetime(2022, 1, 1)

hourly_partitions = HourlyPartitionsDefinition(start_date=f"{start:%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M}")
daily_partitions = DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date=f"{start:%Y-%m-%d}")


@asset(partitions_def=hourly_partitions)
def upstream_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.DataFrame({"date": [context.partition_key]})


@asset(
    partitions_def=daily_partitions,
)
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset: Dict[str, pd.DataFrame]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.concat(list(upstream_asset.values()))


result = materialize(
    [*upstream_asset.to_source_assets(), downstream_asset],
    partition_key=start.strftime(daily_partitions.fmt),
)
downstream_asset_data = result.output_for_node("downstream_asset", "result")
assert (
    len(downstream_asset_data) == 24
), "downstream day should map to upstream 24 hours"
```

The `upstream_asset` becomes a mapping from partition keys to partition values. This is a property of the default I/O manager or any I/O manager inheriting from the <PyObject module="dagster" object="UPathIOManager" />.

A <PyObject object="PartitionMapping" /> can be provided to <PyObject object="AssetIn" /> to configure the mapped upstream partitions.

When writing a custom I/O manager for loading multiple upstream partitions, the mapped keys can be accessed using <PyObject object="InputContext" method="asset_partition_keys" />, <PyObject object="InputContext" method="asset_partition_key_range" />, or <PyObject object="InputContext" method="asset_partitions_time_window" />.

### Writing a per-input I/O manager

In some cases you may find that you need to load an input in a way other than the `load_input` function of the corresponding output's I/O manager. For example, let's say Team A has an op that returns an output as a Pandas DataFrame and specifies an I/O manager that knows how to store and load Pandas DataFrames. Your team is interested in using this output for a new op, but you are required to use PySpark to analyze the data. Unfortunately, you don't have permission to modify Team A's I/O manager to support this case. Instead, you can specify an input manager on your op that will override some of the behavior of Team A's I/O manager.

Since the method for loading an input is directly affected by the way the corresponding output was stored, we recommend defining your input managers as subclasses of existing I/O managers and just updating the `load_input` method. In this example, we load an input as a NumPy array rather than a Pandas DataFrame by writing the following:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/input_managers.py startafter=start_plain_input_manager endbefore=end_plain_input_manager
# in this case PandasIOManager is an existing IO Manager
class MyNumpyLoader(PandasIOManager):
    def load_input(self, context: InputContext) -> np.ndarray:
        file_path = "path/to/dataframe"
        array = np.genfromtxt(file_path, delimiter=",", dtype=None)
        return array


@op(ins={"np_array_input": In(input_manager_key="numpy_manager")})
def analyze_as_numpy(np_array_input: np.ndarray):
    assert isinstance(np_array_input, np.ndarray)


@job(resource_defs={"numpy_manager": MyNumpyLoader(), "io_manager": PandasIOManager()})
def my_job():
    df = produce_pandas_output()
    analyze_as_numpy(df)
```

This may quickly run into issues if the owner of `PandasIOManager` changes the path at which they store outputs. We recommend splitting out path defining logic (or other computations shared by `handle_output` and `load_input`) into new methods that are called when needed.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/input_managers.py startafter=start_better_input_manager endbefore=end_better_input_manager
# this IO Manager is owned by a different team

## Examples

### A custom I/O manager that stores Pandas DataFrames in tables

If your ops produce Pandas DataFrames that populate tables in a data warehouse, you might write something like the following. This I/O manager uses the name assigned to the output as the name of the table to write the output to.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/custom_io_manager.py startafter=start_df_marker endbefore=end_df_marker
from dagster import ConfigurableIOManager, io_manager


class DataframeTableIOManager(ConfigurableIOManager):
    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        # name is the name given to the Out that we're storing for
        table_name = context.name
        write_dataframe_to_table(name=table_name, dataframe=obj)

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        # upstream_output.name is the name given to the Out that we're loading for
        if context.upstream_output:
            table_name = context.upstream_output.name
            return read_dataframe_from_table(name=table_name)


@job(resource_defs={"io_manager": DataframeTableIOManager()})
def my_job():
    op_2(op_1())
```

### Custom filesystem-based I/O manager

Dagster provides a feature-rich base class for filesystem-based I/O managers: <PyObject module="dagster" object="UPathIOManager" />. It's compatible with both local and remote filesystems (like S3 or GCS) by using `universal-pathlib` and `fsspec`. The full list of supported filesystems can be found [here](https://github.com/fsspec/universal_pathlib#currently-supported-filesystems-and-schemes). The `UPathIOManager` also has other important features:

- handles partitioned assets
- handles loading a single upstream partition
- handles loading multiple upstream partitions (with respect to <PyObject object="PartitionMapping" />)
- the `get_metadata` method can be customized to add additional metadata to the output
- the `allow_missing_partitions` metadata value can be set to `True` to skip missing partitions (the default behavior is to raise an error)

The default I/O manager inherits from the `UPathIOManager` and therefore has these features too.

The `UPathIOManager` already implements the `load_input` and `handle_output` methods. Instead, if you want to write a custom `UPathIOManager` the <PyObject module="dagster" object="UPathIOManager" method="dump_to_path" /> and <PyObject module="dagster" object="UPathIOManager" method="load_from_path" /> for a given `universal_pathlib.UPath` should to be implemented. Here are some examples:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/filesystem_io_manager.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_class_marker
import pandas as pd
from upath import UPath

from dagster import InputContext, OutputContext, UPathIOManager


class PandasParquetIOManager(UPathIOManager):
    extension: str = ".parquet"

    def dump_to_path(self, context: OutputContext, obj: pd.DataFrame, path: UPath):
        with path.open("wb") as file:
            obj.to_parquet(file)

    def load_from_path(self, context: InputContext, path: UPath) -> pd.DataFrame:
        with path.open("rb") as file:
            return pd.read_parquet(file)
```

The extension attribute defines the suffix all the file paths generated by the IOManager will end with.

The I/O managers defined above will work with partitioned assets on any filesystem:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/filesystem_io_manager.py startafter=start_def_marker endbefore=end_marker
from typing import Optional

from dagster import ConfigurableIOManagerFactory, EnvVar


class LocalPandasParquetIOManager(ConfigurableIOManagerFactory):
    base_path: Optional[str] = None

    def create_io_manager(self, context) -> PandasParquetIOManager:
        base_path = UPath(self.base_path or context.instance.storage_directory())
        return PandasParquetIOManager(base_path=base_path)


class S3ParquetIOManager(ConfigurableIOManagerFactory):
    base_path: str

    aws_access_key: str = EnvVar("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
    aws_secret_key: str = EnvVar("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")

    def create_io_manager(self, context) -> PandasParquetIOManager:
        base_path = UPath(self.base_path)
        assert str(base_path).startswith("s3://"), base_path
        return PandasParquetIOManager(base_path=base_path)
```

Notice how the local and S3 I/O managers are practically the same - the only difference is in the required resources.

### Providing per-output metadata to an I/O manager

You might want to provide static metadata that controls how particular outputs are stored. You don't plan to change the metadata at runtime, so it makes more sense to attach it to a definition rather than expose it as a configuration option.

For example, if your job produces DataFrames to populate tables in a data warehouse, you might want to specify that each output always goes to a particular table. To accomplish this, you can define `metadata` on each <PyObject module="dagster" object="Out" />:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/metadata.py startafter=ops_start_marker endbefore=ops_end_marker
@op(out=Out(metadata={"schema": "some_schema", "table": "some_table"}))
def op_1():
    """Return a Pandas DataFrame."""


@op(out=Out(metadata={"schema": "other_schema", "table": "other_table"}))
def op_2(_input_dataframe):
    """Return a Pandas DataFrame."""
```

The I/O manager can then access this metadata when storing or retrieving data, via the <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputContext" />.

In this case, the table names are encoded in the job definition. If, instead, you want to be able to set them at run time, the next section describes how.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/metadata.py startafter=io_manager_start_marker endbefore=io_manager_end_marker
class MyIOManager(ConfigurableIOManager):
    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        if context.definition_metadata:
            table_name = context.definition_metadata["table"]
            schema = context.definition_metadata["schema"]
            write_dataframe_to_table(name=table_name, schema=schema, dataframe=obj)
        else:
            raise Exception(
                f"op {context.op_def.name} doesn't have schema and metadata set"
            )

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        if context.upstream_output and context.upstream_output.definition_metadata:
            table_name = context.upstream_output.definition_metadata["table"]
            schema = context.upstream_output.definition_metadata["schema"]
            return read_dataframe_from_table(name=table_name, schema=schema)
        else:
            raise Exception("Upstream output doesn't have schema and metadata set")
```

### Per-input loading in assets

Let's say you have an asset that is set to store and load as a Pandas DataFrame, but you want to write a new asset that processes the first asset as a NumPy array. Rather than update the I/O manager of the first asset to be able to load as a Pandas DataFrame and a NumPy array, you can write a new loader for the new asset.

In this example, we store `upstream_asset` as a Pandas DataFrame, and we write a new I/O manager to load is as a NumPy array in `downstream_asset`

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_input_managers_numpy.py startafter=start_numpy_example endbefore=end_numpy_example
class PandasAssetIOManager(ConfigurableIOManager):
    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        file_path = self._get_path(context)
        store_pandas_dataframe(name=file_path, table=obj)

    def _get_path(self, context):
        return os.path.join(
            "storage",
            f"{context.asset_key.path[-1]}.csv",
        )

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext) -> pd.DataFrame:
        file_path = self._get_path(context)
        return load_pandas_dataframe(name=file_path)


class NumpyAssetIOManager(PandasAssetIOManager):
    def load_input(self, context: InputContext) -> np.ndarray:
        file_path = self._get_path(context)
        return load_numpy_array(name=file_path)


@asset(io_manager_key="pandas_manager")
def upstream_asset() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.DataFrame([1, 2, 3])


@asset(
    ins={"upstream": AssetIn(key_prefix="public", input_manager_key="numpy_manager")}
)
def downstream_asset(upstream: np.ndarray) -> tuple:
    return upstream.shape


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[upstream_asset, downstream_asset],
    resources={
        "pandas_manager": PandasAssetIOManager(),
        "numpy_manager": NumpyAssetIOManager(),
    },
)
```

## Testing an I/O manager

The easiest way to test an I/O manager is to construct an <PyObject module="dagster" object="OutputContext" /> or <PyObject module="dagster" object="InputContext" /> and pass it to the `handle_output` or `load_input` method of the I/O manager. The <PyObject object="build_output_context" /> and <PyObject object="build_input_context" /> functions allow for easy construction of these contexts.

Here's an example for a simple I/O manager that stores outputs in an in-memory dictionary that's keyed on the step and name of the output.

```python file=/concepts/io_management/test_io_manager.py
from dagster import (
    InputContext,
    IOManager,
    OutputContext,
    build_input_context,
    build_output_context,
)


class MyIOManager(IOManager):
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage_dict = {}

    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        self.storage_dict[(context.step_key, context.name)] = obj

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        if context.upstream_output:
            return self.storage_dict[
                (context.upstream_output.step_key, context.upstream_output.name)
            ]


def test_my_io_manager_handle_output():
    manager = MyIOManager()
    context = build_output_context(name="abc", step_key="123")
    manager.handle_output(context, 5)
    assert manager.storage_dict[("123", "abc")] == 5


def test_my_io_manager_load_input():
    manager = MyIOManager()
    manager.storage_dict[("123", "abc")] = 5

    context = build_input_context(
        upstream_output=build_output_context(name="abc", step_key="123")
    )
    assert manager.load_input(context) == 5
```

## Recording metadata from an I/O manager

Sometimes, you may want to record some metadata while handling an output in an I/O manager. To do this, you can invoke <PyObject object="OutputContext" method="add_output_metadata"/> from within the body of the `handle_output` function. Using this, we can modify one of the [above examples](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#a-custom-io-manager-that-stores-pandas-dataframes-in-tables) to now include some helpful metadata in the log:

```python file=/concepts/io_management/custom_io_manager.py startafter=start_metadata_marker endbefore=end_metadata_marker
class DataframeTableIOManagerWithMetadata(ConfigurableIOManager):
    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        table_name = context.name
        write_dataframe_to_table(name=table_name, dataframe=obj)

        context.add_output_metadata({"num_rows": len(obj), "table_name": table_name})

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        if context.upstream_output:
            table_name = context.upstream_output.name
            return read_dataframe_from_table(name=table_name)
```

Any entries yielded this way will be attached to the `Handled Output` event for this output.

Additionally, if the handled output is part of an asset definition, these metadata entries will also be attached to the materialization event created for that asset and show up on the Asset Details page for the asset.
