# Asset Materializations

[Software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) provide a declarative way to define what assets should exist and how to create them. But when it's not known what asset an op is going to materialize until the op runs, you can still create assets using <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events.

"Asset" is Dagster's word for an entity, external to ops, that is mutated or created by an op. An asset might be a table in a database that an op appends to, an ML model in a model store that an op overwrites, or even a slack channel that an op writes messages to.

Op outputs often correspond to assets. For example, an op might be responsible for recreating a table, and one of its outputs might be a dataframe containing the contents of that table.

Assets can also have partitions, which refer to slices of the overall asset. The simplest example would be a table that has a partition for each day. A given op execution may simply write a single day's worth of data to that table, rather than dropping the entire table and replacing it with new data.

Dagster lets you track the interactions between ops, outputs, and assets over time and view them in the Dagit [Asset Catalog](/concepts/dagit/dagit#assets). Every asset has a "key", which serves as a unique identifier for that particular entity. The act of creating or updating the contents of an asset is called a "materialization", and Dagster tracks these materializations using <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events. These events can either be logged by the user at runtime, or automatically created by Dagster in cases where an <PyObject object="AssetKey" /> has been referenced by an op output.

## Relevant APIs

| Name                                                        | Description                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> | Dagster event indicating that an op has materialized an asset. |
| <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetKey" />             | A unique identifier for a particular external asset            |

## Overview

There are two general patterns for dealing with assets when using Dagster:

- Put the logic to write/store assets inside the body of an op.
- Focus the op purely on business logic, and delegate the logic to write/store assets to an [IO manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers).

Regardless of which pattern you are using, <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> events are used to communicate to Dagster that a materialization has occurred. You can create these events either by explicitly logging them at runtime, or (using an experimental interface), have Dagster automatically generate them by defining that a given op output corresponds to a given <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetKey" />.

## Explicit AssetMaterializations

One way of recording materialization events is to log <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> events at runtime. These events should be co-located with your materialization logic, meaning if you store your object within your op body, then you should log from within that op, and if you store your object using an <PyObject module="dagster" object="IOManager" />, then you should log the event from your manager.

### Logging an AssetMaterialization from a Op

To make Dagster aware that we materialized an asset in our op, we can log an <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> event using the method <PyObject object="OpExecutionContext" method="log_event" />. This would involve changing the following op:

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_materialization_ops_marker_0 endbefore=end_materialization_ops_marker_0
from dagster import op


@op
def my_simple_op():
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    return remote_storage_path
```

into something like this:

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_materialization_ops_marker_1 endbefore=end_materialization_ops_marker_1
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, op


@op
def my_materialization_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    context.log_event(
        AssetMaterialization(
            asset_key="my_dataset", description="Persisted result to storage"
        )
    )
    return remote_storage_path
```

We should now see a materialization event in the event log when we execute a job with this op.

### Logging an AssetMaterialization from an IO Manager

To record that an <PyObject object ="IOManager"/> has mutated or created an asset, we can log an <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetMaterialization" /> event from its `handle_output` method. We do this via the method <PyObject object="OutputContext" method="log_event" />.

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_io_managers.py startafter=start_marker_0 endbefore=end_marker_0
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, IOManager


class PandasCsvIOManager(IOManager):
    def load_input(self, context):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)
        return read_csv(file_path)

    def handle_output(self, context, obj):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)

        obj.to_csv(file_path)

        context.log_event(
            AssetMaterialization(
                asset_key=AssetKey(file_path),
                description="Persisted result to storage.",
            )
        )
```

### Attaching Metadata to an AssetMaterialization

There are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with a materialization event, all through the <PyObject module="dagster" object="MetadataEntry" /> class. Each materialization event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log and the [Asset Catalog](/concepts/dagit/dagit#assets).

#### Example: Op body

```python file=concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_materialization_ops_marker_2 endbefore=end_materialization_ops_marker_2
from dagster import op, AssetMaterialization, MetadataValue


@op
def my_metadata_materialization_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    context.log_event(
        AssetMaterialization(
            asset_key="my_dataset",
            description="Persisted result to storage",
            metadata={
                "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
                "path": MetadataValue.path(remote_storage_path),
                "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url(
                    "http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"
                ),
                "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
            },
        )
    )
    return remote_storage_path
```

#### Example: IO Manager

```python file=concepts/assets/materialization_io_managers.py startafter=start_marker_1 endbefore=end_marker_1
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, IOManager


class PandasCsvIOManagerWithAsset(IOManager):
    def load_input(self, context):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)
        return read_csv(file_path)

    def handle_output(self, context, obj):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)

        obj.to_csv(file_path)

        context.log_event(
            AssetMaterialization(
                asset_key=AssetKey(file_path),
                description="Persisted result to storage.",
                metadata={
                    "number of rows": obj.shape[0],
                    "some_column mean": obj["some_column"].mean(),
                },
            )
        )
```

Check our API docs for <PyObject module="dagster" object="MetadataEntry" /> for more details on they types of event metadata available.

### Specifying a partition for an AssetMaterialization

If you are materializing a single slice of an asset (e.g. a single day's worth of data on a larger table), rather than mutating or creating it entirely, you can indicate this to Dagster by including the `partition` argument on the object.

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_partitioned_asset_materialization endbefore=end_partitioned_asset_materialization
from dagster import op, AssetMaterialization


@op(config_schema={"date": str})
def my_partitioned_asset_op(context):
    partition_date = context.op_config["date"]
    df = read_df_for_date(partition_date)
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    context.log_event(
        AssetMaterialization(asset_key="my_dataset", partition=partition_date)
    )
    return remote_storage_path
```

## Linking Op Outputs to Assets <Experimental />

It is fairly common for an asset to correspond to an op output. In the following simplified example, our op produces a dataframe, persists it to storage, and then passes the dataframe along as an output:

```python file=concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_simple_asset_op endbefore=end_simple_asset_op
from dagster import op, Output, AssetMaterialization


@op
def my_asset_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    persist_to_storage(df)
    context.log_event(AssetMaterialization(asset_key="my_dataset"))
    return df
```

In this case, the <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> and the <PyObject object="Output" /> events both correspond to the same data, the dataframe that we have created. With this in mind, we can simplify the above code, and provide useful information to the Dagster framework, by making this link between the `my_dataset` asset and the output of this op explicit.

Just as there are two places in which you can log runtime <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events (within an op body and within an IO manager), we provide two different interfaces for linking an op output to to an asset. Regardless of which you choose, every time the op runs and logs that output, an <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> event will automatically be created to record this information.

If you use an <PyObject object="Output" /> event to yield your output, and specified any metadata entries on it, (see: [Op Event Docs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-events#attaching-metadata-to-outputs)), these entries will automatically be attached to the materialization event for this asset.

### Linking assets to an Output Definition <Experimental />

For cases where you are storing your asset within the body of an op, the easiest way of linking an asset to an op output is with the `asset_key` parameter on the relevant <PyObject object="OutputDefinition"/> in your op. To do this, you may define a constant <PyObject object="AssetKey"/> that identifies the asset you are linking.

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_output_def_mat_op_0 endbefore=end_output_def_mat_op_0
from dagster import op, Output, Out, AssetKey


@op(out=Out(asset_key=AssetKey("my_dataset")))
def my_constant_asset_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    persist_to_storage(df)
    return df
```

### Linking assets to outputs with an IOManager <Experimental />

If you've defined a custom <PyObject object="IOManager"/> to handle storing your op's outputs, the <PyObject object="IOManager"/> will likely be the most natural place to define which asset a particular output will be written to. To do this, you can implement the `get_output_asset_key` function on your <PyObject object="IOManager"/>.

Similar to the above interface, this function takes an <PyObject object="OutputContext"/> and returns an <PyObject object="AssetKey"/>. The following example functions nearly identically to `PandasCsvIOManagerWithMetadata` from the [runtime example](/concepts/assets/asset-materializations#example-io-manager) above.

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_io_managers.py startafter=start_asset_def endbefore=end_asset_def
from dagster import AssetKey, IOManager, MetadataEntry


class PandasCsvIOManagerWithOutputAsset(IOManager):
    def load_input(self, context):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)
        return read_csv(file_path)

    def handle_output(self, context, obj):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)

        obj.to_csv(file_path)

        yield MetadataEntry.int(obj.shape[0], label="number of rows")
        yield MetadataEntry.float(obj["some_column"].mean(), "some_column mean")

    def get_output_asset_key(self, context):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)
        return AssetKey(file_path)
```

When an output is linked to an asset in this way, the generated <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> event will contain any <PyObject object="MetadataEntry" /> information yielded from the `handle_output` function (in addiition to all of the `metadata` specified on the corresponding <PyObject object="Output" /> event).

See the [IO manager docs](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#yielding-metadata-from-an-io-manager) for more information on yielding these entries from an IO manager.

#### Specifying partitions for an output-linked asset

If you are already specifying a `get_output_asset_key` function on your <PyObject object="IOManager" />, you can optionally specify a set of partitions that this manager will be updating or creating by also defining a `get_output_asset_partitions` function. If you do this, an <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> will be created for each of the specified partitions. One useful pattern to pass this partition information (which will likely vary each run) to the manager, is to specify the set of partitions on the configuration of the output. You can do this by providing [per-output configuration](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#providing-per-output-config-to-an-io-manager) on the IO manager.

Then, you can calculate the asset partitions that a particular output will correspond to by reading this output configuration in `get_output_asset_partitions`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_io_managers.py startafter=start_partitioned_asset_def endbefore=end_partitioned_asset_def
from dagster import AssetKey, IOManager, MetadataEntry


class PandasCsvIOManagerWithOutputAssetPartitions(IOManager):
    def load_input(self, context):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)
        return read_csv(file_path)

    def handle_output(self, context, obj):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)

        obj.to_csv(file_path)

        yield MetadataEntry.int(obj.shape[0], label="number of rows")
        yield MetadataEntry.float(obj["some_column"].mean(), "some_column mean")

    def get_output_asset_key(self, context):
        file_path = os.path.join("my_base_dir", context.step_key, context.name)
        return AssetKey(file_path)

    def get_output_asset_partitions(self, context):
        return set(context.config["partitions"])
```

## Asset Lineage <Experimental />

When an op output is linked to an <PyObject object="AssetKey"/>, Dagster can automatically generate lineage information that describes how this asset relates to other output-linked assets.

As a simplified example, imagine a two-op job that first scrapes some user data from an API, storing it to a table, then trains an ML model on that data, persisting it to a model store:

```python file=/concepts/assets/materialization_jobs.py startafter=start_job_0 endbefore=end_job_0
from dagster import op, job, AssetKey, Out


@op(out=Out(asset_key=AssetKey("my_db.users")))
def scrape_users():
    users_df = some_api_call()
    persist_to_db(users_df)
    return users_df


@op(out=Out(asset_key=AssetKey("ml_models.user_prediction")))
def get_prediction_model(users_df):
    my_ml_model = train_prediction_model(users_df)
    persist_to_model_store(my_ml_model)
    return my_ml_model


@job
def my_user_model_job():
    get_prediction_model(scrape_users())
```

In this case, it's certainly fair to say that this ML model, which we have assigned the key `ml_models.user_prediction`, _depends on_ the table that we created, `my_db.users` (it uses the data in the table to train the model).

Why is that? By specifying the structure of your job, you have already defined data depedencies between these ops. By linking the output of `scrape_users` to the input of `get_prediction_model`, we can now infer that whatever this second op outputs will be some function of its input. Furthermore, since we have linked each of these outputs to external assets, we can use this knowledge to say that the asset associated with the output of `get_prediction_model` depends on the asset associated with the output of `scrape_users`.

This feature is still in its early stages, but for now, this lineage information is surfaced in the [Asset Catalog](/concepts/dagit/dagit#assets) page for each asset ("Parent assets"):

## Software-defined assets vs. Asset Materializations

When working with software-defined assets, the assets and their dependencies must be known at definition time. When you look at software-defined assets in Dagit, you can see exactly what assets are going to be materialized before any code runs.

Asset Materializations, on the other hand, are logged at run time. When you run an op, you find out which assets were materialized while the op is running. This allows for some flexibility, like if you wanted to determine which assets should be materialized based on the output of a previous op.
