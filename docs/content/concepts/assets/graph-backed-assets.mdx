# Graph-Backed Assets

[Basic software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#a-basic-software-defined-asset) are computed using a single op. If generating an asset involves multiple discrete computations, you can use graph-backed assets by separating each computation into an op and building a graph to combine your computations. This allows you to launch re-executions of runs at the op boundaries but doesn't require you to link each intermediate value to an asset in persistent storage.

Graph-backed assets are useful if you have an existing graph that produces and consumes assets. Wrapping your graph inside a software-defined asset gives you all the benefits of software-defined assets — like cross-job lineage — without requiring you to change the code inside your graph.

Additionally, graph-backed assets allow you to reuse an existing op across other graph-backed assets and jobs, or within the same graph.

## Defining graph-backed assets

To define a graph-backed asset, use the `from_graph` attribute on the <PyObject object="AssetsDefinition" /> object. The value returned from the graph that becomes the graph-backed asset will be stored in persistent storage as the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start example endbefore=end example
import pandas as pd
from dagster import AssetsDefinition, asset, graph, op


@op(required_resource_keys={"slack"})
def fetch_files_from_slack(context) -> pd.DataFrame:
    files = context.resources.slack.files_list(channel="#random")
    return pd.DataFrame(
        [
            {
                "id": file.get("id"),
                "created": file.get("created"),
                "title": file.get("title"),
                "permalink": file.get("permalink"),
            }
            for file in files
        ]
    )


@op
def store_files(files):
    return files.to_sql(name="slack_files", con=create_db_connection())


@graph
def store_slack_files_in_sql():
    return store_files(fetch_files_from_slack())


graph_asset = AssetsDefinition.from_graph(store_slack_files_in_sql)
```

### Defining basic dependencies for graph-backed assets

The `from_graph` attribute on the `AssetsDefinition` object infers upstream and downstream asset dependencies from the graph definition provided. In the most simple case when the graph returns a singular output, Dagster infers the name of the graph to be the outputted asset key.

In the example below, Dagster creates an asset with key `middle_asset` from the `middle_asset` graph. Just like assets defined via <PyObject object="asset" decorator />, each argument to the decorated graph function is an upstream asset name. `middle_asset` depends on `upstream_asset`, and `downstream_asset` depends on `middle_asset`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_basic_dependencies endbefore=end_basic_dependencies
from dagster import AssetsDefinition, asset, graph


@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return 1


@graph
def middle_asset(upstream_asset):
    return add_one(upstream_asset)


middle_asset = AssetsDefinition.from_graph(middle_asset)


@asset
def downstream_asset(middle_asset):
    return middle_asset + 1
```

When your graph returns multiple outputs, Dagster infers each output name to be the outputted asset key. In the below example, `two_assets_graph` accepts `upstream_asset` and outputs two assets, `first_asset` and `second_asset`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_basic_dependencies_2 endbefore=end_basic_dependencies_2
from dagster import AssetsDefinition, GraphOut, graph


@graph(out={"first_asset": GraphOut(), "second_asset": GraphOut()})
def two_assets_graph(upstream_asset):
    one, two = two_outputs(upstream_asset)
    return {"first_asset": one, "second_asset": two}


two_assets = AssetsDefinition.from_graph(two_assets_graph)
```

### Defining explicit dependencies for graph-backed assets

You can also define dependencies for graph-backed assets explicitly via the `asset_keys_by_input_name` and `asset_keys_by_output_name` arguments to `from_graph`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_explicit_dependencies endbefore=end_explicit_dependencies
from dagster import AssetsDefinition, GraphOut, graph


@graph(out={"one": GraphOut(), "two": GraphOut()})
def return_one_and_two(zero):
    one, two = two_outputs(zero)
    return {"one": one, "two": two}


explicit_deps_asset = AssetsDefinition.from_graph(
    return_one_and_two,
    keys_by_input_name={"zero": AssetKey("upstream_asset")},
    keys_by_output_name={
        "one": AssetKey("asset_one"),
        "two": AssetKey("asset_two"),
    },
)
```

### Advanced: Subsetting graph-backed assets

By default, when executing a graph-backed asset, every asset produced by the graph must be materialized. This means that attempting to selectively execute a subset of assets defined in the graph-backed asset will result in an error.

If the underlying computation is sufficiently flexible to selectively output a subset of assets, a graph-backed asset can be subsetted. For example, let’s say we wanted to define a graph-backed asset with the structure depicted in the image below. In this case, we want to independently materialize `foo_asset` and `baz_asset`.

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Graph-backed asset"
    src="/images/concepts/assets/graph-backed-asset.png"
    width={833}
    height={621}
  />
</center>

In order to selectively output an asset from a graph-backed asset, Dagster will run each op that is a dependency of the outputted asset. In the example, if we wanted to selectively materialize `foo_asset`, Dagster would run `foo` and `bar`. If we wanted to selectively materialize `baz_asset`, Dagster would run all three ops (`foo`, `bar`, and `baz`).

Because the `foo` op yields an asset output (`foo_asset`) and is an upstream dependency of another asset generated from the graph (`baz_asset`), we need to structure `foo` to selectively return outputs depending on the asset subset selected for execution. We can do this by defining `foo` to have optional outputs that are yielded conditionally. Dagster provides a `context.selected_output_names` object on the op context that will return the outputs necessary to generate the asset subset.

During execution, if we select just `baz_asset` for materialization, the below implementation of `foo` will return `{"foo_2"}` for `context.selected_output_names`, preventing `foo_asset` from being materialized.

```python file=/concepts/assets/subset_graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_graph_backed_asset_foo endbefore=end_graph_backed_asset_foo
@op(out={"foo_1": Out(is_required=False), "foo_2": Out(is_required=False)})
def foo(context, bar_1):
    # Selectively returns outputs based on selected assets
    if "foo_1" in context.selected_output_names:
        yield Output(bar_1 + 1, output_name="foo_1")
    if "foo_2" in context.selected_output_names:
        yield Output(bar_1 + 2, output_name="foo_2")
```

Because Dagster flattens each graph into a flat input/output mapping between ops under the hood, any op that produces an output of the graph must be structured to yield its outputs optionally, enabling the outputs to be returned independently.

In the example, `foo` and `baz` produce outputs of `my_graph`. Subsequently, their outputs need to be yielded optionally. Because `foo` yields multiple outputs, we must structure our code to conditionally yield its outputs like in the code snippet above.

However, because `baz` only yields a singular output, Dagster will only run `baz` when its asset output `baz_asset` is selected. So, we don’t have to structure `baz` to return an optional output. Because `bar` does not yield any outputs that are returned from `my_graph`, its outputs do not have to be selectively returned.

We could define the asset using the code below. Notice that `can_subset` must be set to `True` in the asset definition to signify that the graph-backed asset can be subsetted.

```python file=/concepts/assets/subset_graph_backed_asset.py startafter=start_graph_backed_asset_example endbefore=end_graph_backed_asset_example
@op(out={"bar_1": Out(), "bar_2": Out()})
def bar():
    return 1, 2


@op
def baz(foo_2, bar_2):
    return foo_2 + bar_2


@graph(out={"foo_asset": GraphOut(), "baz_asset": GraphOut()})
def my_graph():
    bar_1, bar_2 = bar()
    foo_1, foo_2 = foo(bar_1)
    return {"foo_asset": foo_1, "baz_asset": baz(foo_2, bar_2)}


@repository
def my_repo():
    return [
        define_asset_job("graph_asset"),
        AssetsDefinition.from_graph(my_graph, can_subset=True),
    ]
```

Depending on how outputs are returned from the ops within a graph-backed asset, there could be unexpected materializations. For example, the following `foo` implementation would unexpectedly materialize `foo_asset` if `baz_asset` was the only asset selected for execution.

```python file=/concepts/assets/subset_graph_backed_asset_unexpected_materializations.py startafter=start_unexpected_materialization_foo endbefore=end_unexpected_materialization_foo
@op(out={"foo_1": Out(), "foo_2": Out()})
def foo():
    return 1, 2


# Will unexpectedly materialize foo_asset
my_repo.get_job("graph_asset").execute_in_process(
    asset_selection=[AssetKey("baz_asset")]
)
```

This is because the `foo` op is an upstream dependency of `baz_asset`, and this implementation of `foo` returns both the `foo_1` and `foo_2` outputs. The `foo_1` output is returned as the `foo_asset` output of the graph, causing an unexpected materialization of `foo_asset`.
