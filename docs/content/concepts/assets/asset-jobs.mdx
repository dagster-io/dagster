# Asset jobs

<Note>
  Looking to execute a <a href="/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs">graph</a> of{" "}
  <a href="/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops">ops</a>, which aren't tied to asset
  definitions? Check out the{" "}
  <a href="/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-jobs">Op jobs</a> documentation.
</Note>

[Jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) are the main unit for executing and monitoring [asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) in Dagster. An asset job is a type of [job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) that targets a selection of assets and can be launched:

- Manually from the Dagster UI
- At fixed intervals, by [schedules](/concepts/automation/schedules)
- When external changes occur, using [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors)

---

## Creating asset jobs

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to create a few asset jobs that target the following assets:

```python file=/concepts/assets/non_argument_deps.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import asset


@asset
def sugary_cereals() -> None:
    execute_query(
        "CREATE TABLE sugary_cereals AS SELECT * FROM cereals WHERE sugar_grams > 10"
    )


@asset(deps=[sugary_cereals])
def shopping_list() -> None:
    execute_query("CREATE TABLE shopping_list AS SELECT * FROM sugary_cereals")
```

To create an asset job, use <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />. An asset-based job is based on the [assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) the job targets and their dependencies.

You can target one or multiple assets, or create multiple jobs that target overlapping sets of assets. In the following example, we have two jobs:

- `all_assets_job` targets all assets
- `sugary_cereals_job` targets only the `sugary_cereals` asset

```python file=/concepts/assets/build_job.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import Definitions, define_asset_job


all_assets_job = define_asset_job(name="all_assets_job")
sugary_cereals_job = define_asset_job(
    name="sugary_cereals_job", selection="sugary_cereals"
)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[sugary_cereals, shopping_list],
    jobs=[all_assets_job, sugary_cereals_job],
)
```

## Making asset jobs available to Dagster tools

Including the jobs in a <PyObject object="Definitions"/> object located at the top level of a Python module or file makes asset jobs available to the UI, GraphQL, and the command line. The Dagster tool loads that module as a code location. If you include schedules or sensors, the [code location](/concepts/code-locations) will automatically include jobs that those schedules or sensors target.

```python file=/concepts/assets/jobs_to_definitions.py
from dagster import Definitions, MaterializeResult, asset, define_asset_job


@asset
def number_asset():
    yield MaterializeResult(
        metadata={
            "number": 1,
        }
    )


number_asset_job = define_asset_job(name="number_asset_job", selection="number_asset")

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[number_asset],
    jobs=[number_asset_job],
)
```

## Testing asset jobs

Dagster has built-in support for testing, including separating business logic from environments and setting explicit expectations on uncontrollable inputs. Refer to the [Testing guide](/concepts/testing) for more info and examples.

---

## Executing asset jobs

You can run an asset job in a variety of ways:

- In the Python process where it's defined
- Via the command line
- Via the GraphQL API
- In [the UI](/concepts/webserver/ui). The UI centers on jobs, making it a one-stop shop - you can manually kick off runs for a job and view all historical runs.
