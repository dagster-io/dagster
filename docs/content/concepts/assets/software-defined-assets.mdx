</Note>

An **asset** is an object in persistent storage, such as a table, file, or persisted machine learning model. A **software-defined asset** is a description, in code, of an asset that should exist and how to produce and update that asset.

Software-defined assets enable a declarative approach to data management, in which code is the source of truth on what data assets should exist and how those assets are computed.

A software-defined asset includes the following:

- An <PyObject object="AssetKey" />, which is a handle for referring to the asset.
- A set of upstream asset keys, which refer to assets that the contents of the software-defined asset are derived from.
- A Python function, which is responsible for computing the contents of the asset from its upstream dependencies.

  **Note**: Behind-the-scenes, the Python function is an [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops). Ops are an advanced topic that isn't required to get started with Dagster. A crucial distinction between Software-defined Assets and ops is that Software-defined Assets know about their dependencies, while ops do not. Ops aren't connected to dependencies until they're placed inside a [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).

**Materializing** an asset is the act of running its function and saving the results to persistent storage. You can initiate materializations from [the Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui) or by invoking Python APIs. By default, assets are materialized to pickle files on your local filesystem, but materialization behavior is fully customizable using [I/O managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#applying-io-managers-to-assets). It's possible to materialize an asset in multiple storage environments, such as production and staging.

## Defining assets

- [Basic software-defined assets](#a-basic-software-defined-asset)
- [Assets with dependencies](#assets-with-dependencies)
- [Graph-backed assets and multi-assets](#graph-backed-assets-and-multi-assets)
- [Accessing asset context](#asset-context)
- [Configuring assets](#asset-configuration)

### A basic software-defined asset

The easiest way to create a software-defined asset is with the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator.

```python file=/concepts/assets/basic_asset_definition.py
from dagster import asset


@asset
def my_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

By default, the name of the decorated function, `my_asset`, is used as the asset key. The decorated function is responsible for producing the asset's contents. The asset in this example doesn't depend on any other assets.

### Assets with dependencies

Software-defined assets can depend on other software-defined assets. In this section, we'll show you how to define:

- [Basic asset dependencies](#defining-basic-dependencies)
- [Basic managed-loading dependencies](#defining-basic-managed-loading-dependencies)
- [Explicit managed-loading asset dependencies](#defining-explicit-managed-loading-dependencies)
- [External asset dependencies](#defining-external-asset-dependencies)

#### Defining basic dependencies

You can define a dependency between two assets by passing the upstream asset to the `deps` parameter in the downstream asset's `@asset` decorator.

In this example, the asset `sugary_cereals` creates a new table (`sugary_cereals`) by selecting records from the `cereals` table. Then the asset `shopping_list` creates a new table (`shopping_list`) by selecting records from `sugary_cereals`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/non_argument_deps.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import asset


@asset
def sugary_cereals() -> None:
    execute_query("CREATE TABLE sugary_cereals AS SELECT * FROM cereals")


@asset(deps=[sugary_cereals])
def shopping_list() -> None:
    execute_query("CREATE TABLE shopping_list AS SELECT * FROM sugary_cereals")
```

#### Defining basic managed-loading dependencies

When using basic dependencies, as above, it's expected that if you need direct access to the contents of the asset, the code you include inside your `@asset`-decorated function will load the data from the upstream asset. Dagster alternatively allows you to delegate loading data to an [I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers). To do this, you express the dependency by using the upstream asset name as the name of one of the arguments on the decorated function.

In the following example, `downstream_asset` depends on `upstream_asset`. That means that the contents of `upstream_asset` are provided to the function that computes the contents of `downstream_asset`.

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_dependency.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]
```

In this example, Dagster will load the data returned from `upstream_asset` and pass it as the `upstream_asset` parameter to `downstream_asset`.

#### Defining explicit managed-loading dependencies

If defining dependencies by matching argument names to upstream asset names feels too magical for your tastes, you can also define dependencies in a more explicit way:

```python file=/concepts/assets/explicit_string_asset_dependency.py
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


@asset
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset(ins={"upstream": AssetIn("upstream_asset")})
def downstream_asset(upstream):
    return upstream + [4]
```

In this case, `ins={"upstream": AssetIn("upstream_asset")}` declares that the contents of the asset with the key `upstream_asset` will be provided to the function argument named `upstream`.

Asset keys can also be provided to <PyObject object="AssetIn" /> to explicitly identify the asset. For example:

```python file=/concepts/assets/explicit_asset_dependency_asset_keys.py
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


# If the upstream key has a single segment, you can specify it with a string:
@asset(ins={"upstream": AssetIn(key="upstream_asset")})
def downstream_asset(upstream):
    return upstream + [4]


# If it has multiple segments, you can provide a list:
@asset(ins={"upstream": AssetIn(key=["some_db_schema", "upstream_asset"])})
def another_downstream_asset(upstream):
    return upstream + [10]
```

#### Defining external asset dependencies

Software-defined assets frequently depend on assets that are generated elsewhere. Using <PyObject object="SourceAsset" />, you can include these external assets and allow your other assets to depend on them.

For example:

```python file=/concepts/assets/source_asset.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import AssetKey, SourceAsset, asset

my_source_asset = SourceAsset(key=AssetKey("a_source_asset"))


@asset(deps=[my_source_asset])
def my_derived_asset():
    return execute_query("SELECT * from a_source_asset").as_list() + [4]
```

You can also define a dependency on a `SourceAsset` that will load the data of the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/source_asset.py startafter=start_argument_dependency endbefore=end_argument_dependency
@asset
def my_other_derived_asset(a_source_asset):
    return a_source_asset + [4]
```

**Note**: The source asset's asset key must be provided as the argument to downstream assets. In the previous example, the asset key is `a_source_asset` and not `my_source_asset`.

You can also re-use assets across [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) by including them as source assets. Consider this example for `code_location_1`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/cross_cl_code_location_1.py
# code_location_1.py
from dagster import Definitions, asset


@asset
def code_location_1_asset():
    return 5


defs = Definitions(assets=[code_location_1_asset])
```

And then in `code_location_2`, we've included `code_location_1_asset` as a source asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/cross_cl_code_location_2.py
# code_location_2.py

from dagster import AssetKey, Definitions, SourceAsset, asset

code_location_1_source_asset = SourceAsset(key=AssetKey("code_location_1_asset"))


@asset
def code_location_2_asset(code_location_1_asset):
    return code_location_1_asset + 6


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[code_location_2_asset, code_location_1_source_asset],
)
```

Using source assets has a few advantages over having the code inside of an asset's function load the data without specifying any dependencies:

- **The UI can show asset lineage that includes the source assets**. If different asset definitions in different code locations have the same asset key as a <PyObject object="SourceAsset" /> and both code locations are loaded into the underlying webserver, the UI can represent the asset lineage across the code locations. This can be accomplished using [workspace files](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files).
- **Dagster can use data-loading code factored into an <PyObject object="IOManager" /> to load the contents of the source asset**.
- **Asset dependencies can be written in a consistent way,** independent of whether they're downstream from a source asset or a software-defined asset. This makes it easy to swap out a source asset for a software-defined asset and vice versa.

### Graph-backed assets and multi-assets

If you'd like to define more complex assets, Dagster offers augmented software-defined asset abstractions:

- [Multi-assets](/concepts/assets/multi-assets): A set of software-defined assets that are all updated by the same [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) or [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).
- [Graph-backed assets](/concepts/assets/graph-backed-assets): An asset whose computations are separated into multiple [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) that are combined to build a [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs). If the graph outputs multiple assets, the graph-backed asset is a [multi-asset](/concepts/assets/multi-assets).

### Asset configuration

Assets in Dagster can specify a config schema. This allows you to provide values to assets at run time. The configuration system is explained in detail in the [Config schema documentation](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).

Asset functions can specify an annotated `config` parameter for the assets's configuration. The config class, which subclasses <PyObject object="Config"/> (which inherits from [`pydantic.BaseModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models/#basic-model-usage)) specifies the configuration schema for the asset.

For example, the following downstream asset queries an API endpoint defined through configuration:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_config.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster import Config, asset


@asset
def my_upstream_asset() -> int:
    return 5


class MyDownstreamAssetConfig(Config):
    api_endpoint: str


@asset
def my_downstream_asset(config: MyDownstreamAssetConfig, my_upstream_asset: int) -> int:
    data = requests.get(f"{config.api_endpoint}/data").json()
    return data["value"] + my_upstream_asset
```

Refer to the [Config schema documentation](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) for more configuration info and examples.

### Asset context

When writing an asset, users can optionally provide a first parameter, `context`. When this parameter is supplied, Dagster will supply an <PyObject object="AssetExecutionContext"/> object to the body of the asset which provides access to system information like loggers and the current run id.

For example, to access the logger and log an info message:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_w_context.py startafter=start_w_context endbefore=end_w_context
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, asset


@asset
def context_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    context.log.info(f"My run ID is {context.run_id}")
    ...
```

### Conditional materialization

In some cases, an asset may not need to be updated in storage each time the decorated function is executed. You can use the `output_required` parameter along with `yield` syntax to implement this behavior.

If the `output_required` parameter is set to `False`, and your function does not `yield` an <PyObject object="Output" /> object, then no asset materialization event will be created, the I/O manager will not be invoked, downstream assets will not be materialized, and asset sensors monitoring the asset will not trigger.

```python file=/concepts/assets/conditional_materialization.py
import random

from dagster import Output, asset


@asset(output_required=False)
def may_not_materialize():
    # to simulate an asset that may not always materialize.
    if random.randint(1, 10) < 5:
        yield Output([1, 2, 3, 4])


@asset
def downstream(may_not_materialize):
    # will not run when may_not_materialize doesn't materialize the asset
    return may_not_materialize + [5]
```

### Asset code versions

Assets may be assigned a `code_version`. Versions let you help Dagster track what assets haven't been re-materialized since their code has changed, and avoid performing redundant computation.

```python file=/concepts/assets/code_versions.py startafter=start_single_asset endbefore=end_single_asset
@asset(code_version="1")
def asset_with_version():
    return 100
```

When an asset with a code version is materialized, the generated `AssetMaterialization` is tagged with the version. The UI will indicate when an asset has a different code version than the code version used for its most recent materialization.

Multi-assets may assign different code versions for each of their outputs:

```python file=/concepts/assets/code_versions.py startafter=start_multi_asset endbefore=end_multi_asset
@multi_asset(
    outs={
        "a": AssetOut(code_version="1"),
        "b": AssetOut(code_version="2"),
    }
)
def multi_asset_with_versions():
    yield Output(100, "a")
    yield Output(200, "b")
```

Just as with regular assets, these versions are attached to the `AssetMaterialization` objects for each of the constituent assets and represented in the UI.

### Retrying failed assets

If an exception occurs during asset execution, you can use a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RetryPolicy"  /> to automatically retry the asset within the same run.

In the following example, we've specified the number of times to retry and how long to wait between retries:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_retry.py
from dagster import Backoff, Jitter, RetryPolicy, RetryRequested, asset


@asset(
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
        max_retries=3,
        delay=0.2,  # 200ms
        backoff=Backoff.EXPONENTIAL,
        jitter=Jitter.PLUS_MINUS,
    )
)
def retried_asset():
    return "Retry me!"
```

## Viewing and materializing assets in the UI

Once you've defined a set of assets, you can:

- [Load them into the webserver](#loading-assets-into-the-webserver)
- [View them in the UI](#viewing-assets-in-the-ui)
- [Materialize an ad-hoc set of them in the UI](#materializing-assets-in-the-ui)
- [Build a job](#building-jobs-that-materialize-assets), which materializes a fixed selection of the assets, and can be put on a schedule or sensor

### Loading assets into the webserver

To view and materialize assets in the UI, you can point the underlying webserver at a module that contains asset definitions or lists of asset definitions as module-level attributes:

```shell
dagster dev -m module_with_assets
```

If you want the UI to show both assets and [jobs](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) that target the assets, you can place the assets and jobs together inside a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object. For example:

```python
defs = Definitions(
    assets=[asset_1, asset_2],
    jobs=[asset_job],
)
```

A <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object defines a code location, which is a collection of assets, jobs, resources, and schedules. Refer to the [Code locations documentation](/concepts/code-locations) for more info.

### Viewing assets in the UI

- [Viewing all assets](#asset-catalog)
- [Details for an asset](#asset-details)
- [Dependency graph](#dependency-graph)

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Asset catalog (all assets)">

#### Asset catalog

To view a list of all your assets, click **Assets** in the top navigation. This opens the **Asset catalog**:

<!-- ![Asset catalog page in the UI](/images/concepts/webserver/asset-catalog.png) -->

<Image
alt="Asset catalog page in the UI"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/asset-catalog.png"
width={3572}
height={1944}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Asset details">

#### Asset details

View the **Asset details** page for an asset by clicking on its name:

<!-- ![Asset details page in the UI](/images/concepts/webserver/asset-details.png) -->

<Image
alt="Asset details page in the UI"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/asset-details.png"
width={3062}
height={1628}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Dependency graph">

#### Dependency graph

To view a graph of all assets and their dependencies, you can:

- Click **View global asset lineage** in the [**Asset catalog**](#asset-catalog)
- Click the **Lineage tab** in the [**Asset details** page](#asset-details)

To show a subset of assets in the graph, use the **search bar** next to the **Filter** button. Refer to the [Asset selection syntax reference](/concepts/assets/asset-selection-syntax) for more info and examples using the query syntax.

<!-- ![Asset lineage graph](/images/concepts/webserver/global-asset-lineage.png) -->

<Image
alt="Asset lineage graph"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/global-asset-lineage.png"
width={3574}
height={1944}
/>

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Materializing assets in the UI

In the UI, you can launch runs that materialize assets by:

- Navigating to the [**Asset details** page](#asset-details) for the asset and clicking the **Materialize** button in the upper right corner.
- Navigating to the graph view of the [**Asset catalog** page](#asset-catalog) and clicking the **Materialize** button in the upper right corner. You can also click on individual assets to collect a subset to materialize.

---

## Building jobs that materialize assets

Jobs that target assets can materialize a fixed selection of assets each time they run and be placed on schedules and sensors. Refer to the [Asset jobs documentation](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) for more info and examples.

---

## Grouping assets

To help keep your assets tidy, you can organize them into groups. Grouping assets by project, concept, and so on simplifies [keeping track of them in the UI](#viewing-asset-groups-in-the-ui). Each asset is assigned to a single group, which by default is called "default".

- [Assigning assets to groups](#assigning-assets-to-groups)
- [Viewing asset groups in the UI](#viewing-asset-groups-in-the-ui)

### Assigning assets to groups

In Dagster, there are two ways to assign assets to groups:

- [By specifying a group name on an individual asset](#on-individual-assets)
- [By using the `group_name` argument when calling `load_assets_from_package_module`](#from-assets-in-a-sub-module) (**recommended**)

By default, assets that aren't assigned to a group will be placed in a group named `default`. Use the UI to [view these assets](#viewing-asset-groups-in-the-ui).

#### On individual assets

Assets can also be given groups on an individual basis by specifying an argument when creating the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_group_argument.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
@asset(group_name="cereal_assets")
def nabisco_cereals():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

#### From assets in a sub-module

**This recommended approach** constructs a group of assets from a specified module in your project. Using the `load_assets_from_package_module` function, you can import all assets in a module and apply a grouping:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_group_module.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from my_package import cereal

cereal_assets = load_assets_from_package_module(
    cereal,
    group_name="cereal_assets",
)
```

If any of the assets in the module already has a `group_name` explicitly set on it, you'll encounter a `Group name already exists on assets` error.

### Viewing asset groups in the UI

To view your asset groups in the UI, open the left navigation by clicking the **menu icon in the top left corner**. As asset groups are grouped in code locations, you may need to open a code location to view its asset groups.

Click the asset group to open a dependency graph for all assets in the group. For example, in the following image, the dependency graph for the `activity_analytics` asset group is currently displayed:

<!-- ![Dependency graph for an asset group](/images/concepts/assets/asset-group-dependency-graph.png) -->

<Image
alt="Dependency graph for an asset group"
src="/images/concepts/assets/asset-group-dependency-graph.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

---

## Testing

When writing unit tests, you can treat the function decorated by <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> as a regular Python function.

Consider a simple asset with no upstream dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_simple_asset endbefore=end_simple_asset
@asset
def my_simple_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

When writing a unit test, you can directly invoke the decorated function:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_simple_asset endbefore=end_test_simple_asset
def test_my_simple_asset():
    result = my_simple_asset()
    assert result == [1, 2, 3]
```

If you have an asset with managed-loading upstream dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_more_complex_asset endbefore=end_more_complex_asset
@asset
def more_complex_asset(my_simple_asset):
    return my_simple_asset + [4, 5, 6]
```

You can manually provide values for those dependencies in your unit test. This allows you to test assets in isolation from one another:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_more_complex_asset endbefore=end_test_more_complex_asset
def test_more_complex_asset():
    result = more_complex_asset([0])
    assert result == [0, 4, 5, 6]
```

If you use config of resources in your asset, they will be provided automatically during execution. When writing unit tests, you may provide them directly when invoking the asset function:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_asset_with_resource endbefore=end_asset_with_resource
class MyConfig(Config):
    api_url: str


class MyAPIResource(ConfigurableResource):
    def query(self, url) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return requests.get(url).json()


@asset
def uses_config_and_resource(config: MyConfig, my_api: MyAPIResource):
    return my_api.query(config.api_url)


def test_uses_resource() -> None:
    result = uses_config_and_resource(
        config=MyConfig(api_url="https://dagster.io"), my_api=MyAPIResource()
    )
    assert result == {"foo": "bar"}
```

If you use a context object in your function, you can use <PyObject object="build_asset_context" /> to generate the `context` object.

Consider the following asset that uses a context object:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_with_context_asset endbefore=end_with_context_asset
@asset
def uses_context(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    context.log.info(context.run_id)
    return "bar"
```

When writing a unit test, use <PyObject object="build_asset_context" /> to mock the `context` and provide values for testing:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_with_context_asset endbefore=end_test_with_context_asset
def test_uses_context():
    context = build_asset_context()
    result = uses_context(context)
    assert result == "bar"
```

---

## Loading asset values outside of Dagster runs

It's sometimes useful to load an asset as a Python object outside of a Dagster run, such as performing exploratory analysis on data inside a Jupyter notebook.

For this, you can use <PyObject object="Definitions" method="load_asset_value" />:

```python file=/concepts/assets/load_asset_values.py startafter=single_asset_start_marker endbefore=single_asset_end_marker dedent=4
asset1_value = defs.load_asset_value(AssetKey("asset1"))
```

To load the values of multiple assets, use <PyObject object="Definitions" method="get_asset_value_loader" />, which avoids spinning up resources separately for each asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/load_asset_values.py startafter=multiple_asset_start_marker endbefore=multiple_asset_end_marker dedent=4
with defs.get_asset_value_loader() as loader:
    asset1_value = loader.load_asset_value(AssetKey("asset1"))
    asset2_value = loader.load_asset_value(AssetKey("asset2"))
```

---

## Examples

- [Multi-component asset keys](#multi-component-asset-keys)
- [Recording materialization metadata](#recording-materialization-metadata)
- [Attaching definition metadata](#attaching-definition-metadata)

### Multi-component asset keys

Assets are often objects in systems with hierarchical namespaces, like filesystems. Because of this, it often makes sense for an asset key to be a list of strings, instead of just a single string. To define an asset with a multi-part asset key, use the `key_prefix` argument-- this can be either a list of strings or a single string with segments delimited by "/". The full asset key is formed by prepending the `key_prefix` to the asset name (which defaults to the name of the decorated function).

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_component_asset_key.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


@asset(key_prefix=["one", "two", "three"])
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset(ins={"upstream_asset": AssetIn(key_prefix="one/two/three")})
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]
```

### Recording materialization metadata

Dagster supports attaching arbitrary [metadata](/\_apidocs/ops#dagster.MetadataValue) to asset materializations. This metadata will be displayed on the "Activity" tab of the "Asset Details" page in the UI. If it's numeric, it will be plotted. To attach metadata, your asset can return an <PyObject object="Output" /> object that contains the output value and a dictionary of metadata:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_materialization_metadata.py
from pandas import DataFrame

from dagster import Output, asset


@asset
def table1() -> Output[DataFrame]:
    df = DataFrame({"col1": [1, 2], "col2": [3, 4]})
    return Output(df, metadata={"num_rows": df.shape[0]})
```

This works even if you're not returning an object from your decorated function:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_materialization_metadata_none.py
from dagster import Output, asset


@asset
def table1() -> Output[None]:
    ...  # write out some data to table1
    return Output(None, metadata={"num_rows": 25})
```

#### Recording materialization metadata using I/O managers

Sometimes it's useful to record the same metadata for all assets that are stored in the same way. E.g. if you have a set of assets that are all stored on a filesystem, you might want to record the number of bytes they occupy on disk every time one is materialized. You can achieve this by [recording metadata from an I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers#recording-metadata-from-an-io-manager) that's shared by the assets.

### Attaching definition metadata

Dagster supports attaching arbitrary [metadata](/\_apidocs/ops#dagster.MetadataValue) to asset definitions. This metadata will be displayed on the "Definition" tab of the "Asset Details" page in the UI. This is useful for metadata that describes how the asset should be handled, rather than metadata that describes the contents that were produced by a particular run.

To attach metadata, supply a `metadata` dictionary to the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_definition_metadata.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
@asset(metadata={"owner": "alice@mycompany.com", "priority": "high"})
def my_asset():
    return 5
```
