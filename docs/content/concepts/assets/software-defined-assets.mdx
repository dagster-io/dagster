</Note>

An **asset** is an object in persistent storage, such as a table, file, or persisted machine learning model. An **asset definition** is a description, in code, of an asset that should exist and how to produce and update that asset.

Asset definitions enable a declarative approach to data management, in which code is the source of truth on what data assets should exist and how those assets are computed.

An asset definition includes the following:

- An <PyObject object="AssetKey" />, which is a handle for referring to the asset.
- A set of upstream asset keys, which refer to assets that the contents of the asset definition are derived from.
- A Python function, which is responsible for computing the contents of the asset from its upstream dependencies and storing the results.

  **Note**: Behind-the-scenes, the Python function is an [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops). Ops are an advanced topic that isn't required to get started with Dagster. A crucial distinction between asset definitions and ops is that asset definitions know about their dependencies, while ops do not. Ops aren't connected to dependencies until they're placed inside a [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).

**Materializing** an asset is the act of running its function and saving the results to persistent storage. You can initiate materializations from [the Dagster UI](/concepts/webserver/ui) or by invoking Python APIs.

## Defining assets

- [Basic asset definitions](#basic-asset-definitions)
- [Assets with dependencies](#assets-with-dependencies)
- [Graph-backed assets and multi-assets](#graph-backed-assets-and-multi-assets)
- [Accessing asset context](#asset-context)
- [Configuring assets](#asset-configuration)

### Basic asset definitions

The easiest way to create an asset definition is with the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator.

```python file=/concepts/assets/basic_asset_definition.py
import json
import os

from dagster import asset


@asset
def my_asset():
    os.makedirs("data", exist_ok=True)
    with open("data/my_asset.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump([1, 2, 3], f)
```

By default, the name of the decorated function, `my_asset`, is used as the asset key. The decorated function is responsible for producing the asset's contents. The asset in this example doesn't depend on any other assets.

### Assets with dependencies

Asset definitions can depend on other asset definitions. In this section, we'll show you how to define:

- [Basic asset dependencies](#defining-basic-dependencies)
- [Asset dependencies across code locations](#defining-asset-dependencies-across-code-locations)

#### Defining basic dependencies

You can define a dependency between two assets by passing the upstream asset to the `deps` parameter in the downstream asset's `@asset` decorator.

In this example, the asset `sugary_cereals` creates a new table (`sugary_cereals`) by selecting records from the `cereals` table. Then the asset `shopping_list` creates a new table (`shopping_list`) by selecting records from `sugary_cereals`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/non_argument_deps.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import asset


@asset
def sugary_cereals() -> None:
    execute_query(
        "CREATE TABLE sugary_cereals AS SELECT * FROM cereals WHERE sugar_grams > 10"
    )


@asset(deps=[sugary_cereals])
def shopping_list() -> None:
    execute_query("CREATE TABLE shopping_list AS SELECT * FROM sugary_cereals")
```

#### Defining asset dependencies across code locations

Assets can depend on assets in different [code locations](/concepts/code-locations). Consider this example for `code_location_1`:

```python file=/concepts/assets/cross_cl_code_location_1.py startafter=start endbefore=end
# code_location_1.py
import json

from dagster import Definitions, asset


@asset
def code_location_1_asset():
    with open("/data/code_location_1_asset.json", "w+") as f:
        json.dump(5, f)


defs = Definitions(assets=[code_location_1_asset])
```

In `code_location_2`, we can then reference it via its asset key:

```python file=/concepts/assets/cross_cl_code_location_2.py startafter=start endbefore=end
# code_location_2.py
import json

from dagster import AssetKey, Definitions, asset


@asset(deps=["code_location_1_asset"])
def code_location_2_asset():
    with open("/data/code_location_1_asset.json") as f:
        x = json.load(f)

    with open("/data/code_location_2_asset.json", "w+") as f:
        json.dump(x + 6, f)


defs = Definitions(assets=[code_location_2_asset])
```

### Graph-backed assets and multi-assets

If you'd like to define more complex assets, Dagster offers augmented asset definition abstractions:

- [Multi-assets](/concepts/assets/multi-assets): A set of asset definitions that are all updated by the same [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) or [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).
- [Graph-backed assets](/concepts/assets/graph-backed-assets): An asset whose computations are separated into multiple [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) that are combined to build a [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs). If the graph outputs multiple assets, the graph-backed asset is a [multi-asset](/concepts/assets/multi-assets).

### Asset configuration

Assets in Dagster can specify a config schema. This allows you to provide values to assets at run time. The configuration system is explained in detail in the [Config schema documentation](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).

Asset functions can specify an annotated `config` parameter for the assets's configuration. The config class, which subclasses <PyObject object="Config"/> (which inherits from [`pydantic.BaseModel`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/models/#basic-model-usage)) specifies the configuration schema for the asset.

For example, the following downstream asset queries an API endpoint defined through configuration:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_config.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster import Config, asset


class MyDownstreamAssetConfig(Config):
    api_endpoint: str


@asset
def my_downstream_asset(config: MyDownstreamAssetConfig):
    data = requests.get(f"{config.api_endpoint}/data").json()
    ...
```

Refer to the [Config schema documentation](/concepts/configuration/config-schema) for more configuration info and examples.

### Asset context

When writing an asset, users can optionally provide a first parameter, `context`. When this parameter is supplied, Dagster will supply an <PyObject object="AssetExecutionContext"/> object to the body of the asset which provides access to system information like loggers and the current run ID.

For example, to access the logger and log an info message:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_w_context.py startafter=start_w_context endbefore=end_w_context
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, asset


@asset
def context_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    context.log.info(f"My run ID is {context.run.run_id}")
    ...
```

### Asset code versions

Assets may be assigned a `code_version`. Versions let you help Dagster track what assets haven't been re-materialized since their code has changed, and avoid performing redundant computation.

```python file=/concepts/assets/code_versions.py startafter=start_single_asset endbefore=end_single_asset
@asset(code_version="1")
def asset_with_version():
    with open("data/asset_with_version.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(100, f)
```

When an asset with a code version is materialized, the generated `AssetMaterialization` is tagged with the version. The UI will indicate when an asset has a different code version than the code version used for its most recent materialization.

### Defining metadata and tags

Dagster offers several ways to provide useful information and documentation alongside your data pipelines, including metadata and tagging. For example, you can attach metadata to an asset that calculates how many records are processed during each run and then view the data as a plot in the Dagster UI!

Check out the [Metadata & tags](/concepts/metadata-tags) documentation to get started.

### Retrying failed assets

If an exception occurs during asset execution, you can use a <PyObject module="dagster" object="RetryPolicy"  /> to automatically retry the asset within the same run.

In the following example, we've specified the number of times to retry and how long to wait between retries:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_retry.py
from dagster import (
    AssetExecutionContext,
    Backoff,
    Jitter,
    RetryPolicy,
    RetryRequested,
    asset,
)


@asset(
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(
        max_retries=3,
        delay=0.2,  # 200ms
        backoff=Backoff.EXPONENTIAL,
        jitter=Jitter.PLUS_MINUS,
    )
)
def retried_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    context.log.info("Retry me!")
```

---

## Viewing and materializing assets in the UI

Once you've defined a set of assets, you can:

- [Load them into the webserver](#loading-assets-into-the-webserver)
- [View them in the UI](#viewing-assets-in-the-ui)
- [Materialize an ad-hoc set of them in the UI](#materializing-assets-in-the-ui)
- [Build a job](#building-jobs-that-materialize-assets), which materializes a fixed selection of the assets, and can be put on a schedule or sensor

### Loading assets into the webserver

To view and materialize assets in the UI, you can point the underlying webserver at a module that contains asset definitions or lists of asset definitions as module-level attributes:

```shell
dagster dev -m module_with_assets
```

If you want the UI to show both assets and [jobs](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) that target the assets, you can place the assets and jobs together inside a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object. For example:

```python
defs = Definitions(
    assets=[asset_1, asset_2],
    jobs=[asset_job],
)
```

A <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object defines a code location, which is a collection of assets, jobs, resources, and schedules. Refer to the [Code locations documentation](/concepts/code-locations) for more info.

### Viewing assets in the UI

- [Viewing all assets](#asset-catalog)
- [Details for an asset](#asset-details)
- [Dependency graph](#dependency-graph)

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Asset catalog (all assets)">

#### Asset catalog

To view a list of all your assets, click **Assets** in the top navigation. This opens the **Asset catalog**:

<!-- ![Asset catalog page in the UI](/images/concepts/webserver/asset-catalog.png) -->

<Image
alt="Asset catalog page in the UI"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/asset-catalog.png"
width={3572}
height={1944}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Asset details">

#### Asset details

View the **Asset details** page for an asset by clicking on its name:

<!-- ![Asset details page in the UI](/images/concepts/webserver/asset-details.png) -->

<Image
alt="Asset details page in the UI"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/asset-details.png"
width={3062}
height={1628}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Dependency graph">

#### Dependency graph

To view a graph of all assets and their dependencies, you can:

- Click **View global asset lineage** in the [**Asset catalog**](#asset-catalog)
- Click the **Lineage tab** in the [**Asset details** page](#asset-details)

To show a subset of assets in the graph, use the **search bar** next to the **Filter** button. Refer to the [Asset selection syntax reference](/concepts/assets/asset-selection-syntax) for more info and examples using the query syntax.

<!-- ![Asset lineage graph](/images/concepts/webserver/global-asset-lineage.png) -->

<Image
alt="Asset lineage graph"
src="/images/concepts/webserver/global-asset-lineage.png"
width={3574}
height={1944}
/>

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Materializing assets in the UI

In the UI, you can launch runs that materialize assets by:

- Navigating to the [**Asset details** page](#asset-details) for the asset and clicking the **Materialize** button in the upper right corner.
- Navigating to the graph view of the [**Asset catalog** page](#asset-catalog) and clicking the **Materialize** button in the upper right corner. You can also click on individual assets to collect a subset to materialize.

---

## Building jobs that materialize assets

Jobs that target assets can materialize a fixed selection of assets each time they run and be placed on schedules and sensors. Refer to the [Asset jobs documentation](/concepts/assets/asset-jobs) for more info and examples.

---

## Grouping assets

To help keep your assets tidy, you can organize them into groups. Grouping assets by project, concept, and so on simplifies [keeping track of them in the UI](#viewing-asset-groups-in-the-ui). Each asset is assigned to a single group, which by default is called "default".

- [Assigning assets to groups](#assigning-assets-to-groups)
- [Viewing asset groups in the UI](#viewing-asset-groups-in-the-ui)

### Assigning assets to groups

In Dagster, there are two ways to assign assets to groups:

- [By specifying a group name on an individual asset](#on-individual-assets)
- [By using the `group_name` argument when calling `load_assets_from_package_module`](#from-assets-in-a-sub-module) (**recommended**)

By default, assets that aren't assigned to a group will be placed in a group named `default`. Use the UI to [view these assets](#viewing-asset-groups-in-the-ui).

#### On individual assets

Assets can also be given groups on an individual basis by specifying an argument when creating the asset:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_group_argument.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
@asset(group_name="cereal_assets")
def nabisco_cereals():
    execute_query(
        "CREATE TABLE nabisco_cereals AS SELECT * FROM cereals WHERE manufacturer = 'Nabisco'"
    )
```

#### From assets in a sub-module

**This recommended approach** constructs a group of assets from a specified module in your project. Using the `load_assets_from_package_module` function, you can import all assets in a module and apply a grouping:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_group_module.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from my_package import cereal

cereal_assets = load_assets_from_package_module(
    cereal,
    group_name="cereal_assets",
)
```

If any of the assets in the module already has a `group_name` explicitly set on it, you'll encounter a `Group name already exists on assets` error.

### Viewing asset groups in the UI

To view your asset groups in the UI, open the left navigation by clicking the **menu icon in the top left corner**. As asset groups are grouped in code locations, you may need to open a code location to view its asset groups.

Click the asset group to open a dependency graph for all assets in the group. For example, in the following image, the dependency graph for the `activity_analytics` asset group is currently displayed:

<!-- ![Dependency graph for an asset group](/images/concepts/assets/asset-group-dependency-graph.png) -->

<Image
alt="Dependency graph for an asset group"
src="/images/concepts/assets/asset-group-dependency-graph.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

## Testing

When writing unit tests, you can treat the function decorated by <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> as a regular Python function.

Consider a simple asset with no upstream dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_simple_asset endbefore=end_simple_asset
@asset
def my_simple_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]
```

When writing a unit test, you can directly invoke the decorated function:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_simple_asset endbefore=end_test_simple_asset
def test_my_simple_asset():
    result = my_simple_asset()
    assert result == [1, 2, 3]
```

If you have an asset with managed-loading upstream dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_more_complex_asset endbefore=end_more_complex_asset
@asset
def more_complex_asset(my_simple_asset):
    return my_simple_asset + [4, 5, 6]
```

You can manually provide values for those dependencies in your unit test. This allows you to test assets in isolation from one another:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_more_complex_asset endbefore=end_test_more_complex_asset
def test_more_complex_asset():
    result = more_complex_asset([0])
    assert result == [0, 4, 5, 6]
```

If you use config of resources in your asset, they will be provided automatically during execution. When writing unit tests, you may provide them directly when invoking the asset function:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_asset_with_resource endbefore=end_asset_with_resource
class MyConfig(Config):
    api_url: str


class MyAPIResource(ConfigurableResource):
    def query(self, url) -> dict[str, Any]:
        return requests.get(url).json()


@asset
def uses_config_and_resource(config: MyConfig, my_api: MyAPIResource):
    return my_api.query(config.api_url)


def test_uses_resource() -> None:
    result = uses_config_and_resource(
        config=MyConfig(api_url="https://dagster.io"), my_api=MyAPIResource()
    )
    assert result == {"foo": "bar"}
```

If you use a context object in your function, you can use <PyObject object="build_asset_context" /> to generate the `context` object.

Consider the following asset that uses a context object:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_with_context_asset endbefore=end_with_context_asset
@asset
def uses_context(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    context.log.info(context.run.run_id)
    return "bar"
```

When writing a unit test, use <PyObject object="build_asset_context" /> to mock the `context` and provide values for testing:

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_testing.py startafter=start_test_with_context_asset endbefore=end_test_with_context_asset
def test_uses_context():
    context = build_asset_context()
    result = uses_context(context)
    assert result == "bar"
```

---

## Examples

- [Multi-component asset keys](#multi-component-asset-keys)

### Multi-component asset keys

Assets are often objects in systems with hierarchical namespaces, like filesystems. Because of this, it often makes sense for an asset key to be a list of strings, instead of just a single string. To define an asset with a multi-part asset key, use the `key_prefix` argument with a list of strings. The full asset key is formed by prepending the `key_prefix` to the asset name (which defaults to the name of the decorated function).

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_component_asset_key.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker
from dagster import AssetIn, asset


@asset(key_prefix=["one", "two", "three"])
def upstream_asset():
    return [1, 2, 3]


@asset(ins={"upstream_asset": AssetIn(key_prefix=["one", "two", "three"])})
def downstream_asset(upstream_asset):
    return upstream_asset + [4]
```
