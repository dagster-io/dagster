# Multi-Assets

A multi-asset represents a set of software-defined assets that are all updated by the same [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) or [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs).

## Relevant APIs

| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| <PyObject object="multi_asset" decorator /> | A decorator used to define multi-assets. |

## Overview

When working with [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets), it's sometimes inconvenient or impossible to map each persisted asset to a unique [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) or [graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs). A multi-asset is a way to define a single op or graph that will produce the contents of multiple data assets at once.

Multi-assets may be useful in the following scenarios:

- A single call to an API results in multiple tables being updated (e.g. Airbyte, Fivetran, dbt).
- The same in-memory object is used to compute multiple assets.

## Defining multi-assets

The function responsible for computing the contents of any software-defined asset is an [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops). Multi-assets are responsible for updating multiple assets, so the underlying op will have multiple outputs -- one for each associated asset.

### A basic multi-asset

The easiest way to create a multi-asset is with the <PyObject object="multi_asset" decorator /> decorator. This decorator functions similarly to the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator, but requires an `outs` parameter specifying each output asset of the function.

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_assets.py startafter=start_basic_multi_asset endbefore=end_basic_multi_asset
from dagster import AssetOut, multi_asset, AssetExecutionContext


@multi_asset(
    outs={
        "my_string_asset": AssetOut(),
        "my_int_asset": AssetOut(),
    }
)
def my_function():
    return "abc", 123
```

By default, the names of the outputs will be used to form the asset keys of the multi-asset. The decorated function will be used to create the op for these assets and must emit an output for each of them. In this case, we can emit multiple outputs by returning a tuple of values, one for each asset.

### Conditional materialization

In some cases, an asset may not need to be updated in storage each time the decorated function is executed. You can use the `is_required` parameter along with `yield` syntax to implement this behavior.

If the `is_required` parameter is set to `False` on an output, and your function does not `yield` an <PyObject object="Output" /> object for that output, then no asset materialization event will be created, the I/O manager will not be invoked, downstream assets will not be materialized, and asset sensors monitoring the asset will not trigger.

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_asset_conditional_materialization.py
import random

from dagster import AssetOut, Output, asset, multi_asset


@multi_asset(
    outs={"asset1": AssetOut(is_required=False), "asset2": AssetOut(is_required=False)}
)
def assets_1_and_2():
    if random.randint(1, 10) < 5:
        yield Output([1, 2, 3, 4], output_name="asset1")

    if random.randint(1, 10) < 5:
        yield Output([6, 7, 8, 9], output_name="asset2")


@asset
def downstream1(asset1):
    # will not run when assets_1_and_2 doesn't materialize the asset1
    return asset1 + [5]


@asset
def downstream2(asset2):
    # will not run when assets_1_and_2 doesn't materialize the asset2
    return asset2 + [10]
```

### Subsetting multi-assets

By default, it is assumed that the computation inside of a multi-asset will always produce the contents all of the associated assets. This means that attempting to execute a set of assets that produces some, but not all, of the assets defined by a given multi-asset will result in an error.

Sometimes, the underlying computation is sufficiently flexible to allow for computing an arbitrary subset of the assets associated with it. In these cases, set the `is_required` attribute of the outputs to `False`, and set the `can_subset` parameter of the decorator to `True`.

Inside the body of the function, we can use `context.selected_output_names` or `context.selected_asset_keys` to find out which computations should be run.

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_assets.py startafter=start_subsettable_multi_asset endbefore=end_subsettable_multi_asset
from dagster import AssetOut, Output, multi_asset


@multi_asset(
    outs={
        "a": AssetOut(is_required=False),
        "b": AssetOut(is_required=False),
    },
    can_subset=True,
)
def split_actions(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    if "a" in context.selected_output_names:
        yield Output(value=123, output_name="a")
    if "b" in context.selected_output_names:
        yield Output(value=456, output_name="b")
```

Because our outputs are now optional, we can no longer rely on returning a tuple of values, as we don't know in advance which values will be computed. Instead, we explicitly `yield` each output that we're expected to create.

### Dependencies inside multi-assets

When a multi-asset is created, it is assumed that each output asset depends on all of the input assets. This may not always be the case, however.

In these situations, you may optionally provide a mapping from each output asset to the set of <PyObject object="AssetKey" />s that it depends on. This information is used to display lineage information in the Dagster UI and for parsing selections over your asset graph.

```python file=/concepts/assets/multi_assets.py startafter=start_asset_deps_multi_asset endbefore=end_asset_deps_multi_asset
from dagster import AssetKey, AssetOut, Output, multi_asset


@multi_asset(
    outs={"c": AssetOut(), "d": AssetOut()},
    internal_asset_deps={
        "c": {AssetKey("a")},
        "d": {AssetKey("b")},
    },
)
def my_complex_assets(a, b):
    # c only depends on a
    yield Output(value=a + 1, output_name="c")
    # d only depends on b
    yield Output(value=b + 1, output_name="d")
```
