# Op Events and Exceptions

Within the body of an op, it is possible to communicate with the Dagster framework either by yielding an event, logging an event, or raising an exception. This page describes these different possibilities and the scenarios in which you might use them.

## Overview

Within the body of an op, a stream of structured events can be yielded or logged. These events will be processed by Dagster and recorded in the event log, along with some additional context about the op that emitted it.

It is also possible to raise Dagster-specific exceptions, which will indicate to the framework to halt the op execution entirely and perform some action.

### Event Metadata

Often, it may be useful to attach some arbitrary information to an event or exception that is not captured by its basic parameters. Through the <PyObject object="MetadataEntry"/> and <PyObject object="MetadataValue"/> classes, we provide a consistent interface for specifying this metadata as a set of "entries". Individual entries are instances of the `MetadataEntry` class, which is a simple container for a string `label` and a typed `value`. The available value types are accessible through a static API defined on `MetadataValue`. These include simple datatypes (`MetadataValue.float`, `MetadataValue.int`, `MetadataValue.text`), as well as more complex information such as markdown and json (`MetadataValue.md`, `MetadataValue.json`). Depending on the type of its `value`, a `MetadataEntry` will be rendered in Dagit in a more useful format than a simple unstructured string.

Metadata is attached to events at construction time. There are currently two available metadata specification keyword arguments on all event constructors: (1) `metadata` takes a dictionary mapping string `labels` to `MetadataValue` objects. Under the hood, this is resolved to a list of `MetadataEntry` objects. (2) `metadata_entries` takes a list of `MetadataEntry` objects directly. The `metadata_entries` argument is deprecated-- new code should use the `metadata` dictionary form.

## Events

Yielding events from within the body of an op is a useful way of communicating with the Dagster framework. The most critical event to the functionality of Dagster is the <PyObject object="Output"/> event, which allows output data to be passed on from one op to the next. However, we also provide interfaces to inform Dagster about external assets and data quality checks during the run of an op.

### Output Objects

Because returning a value from an op is such a fundamental part of creating a data pipeline, we have a few different interfaces for this functionality.

For many use cases, Dagster ops can be used directly with python's native type annotations without additional modification. Check out the docs on [Op Outputs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops#outputs) to learn more about this functionality. Dagster also provides the <PyObject object="Output"/> object, which opens up additional functionality to outputs when using Dagster, such as [specifying output metadata](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-events#attaching-metadata-to-outputs) and [conditional branching](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs-graphs#conditional-branching), all while maintaining coherent type annotations.

<PyObject object="Output" /> objects can be either returned or yielded. The Output
type is also generic, for use with return annotations:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_op_output_4 endbefore=end_op_output_4
from dagster import Output, op
from typing import Tuple

# Using Output as type annotation without inner type
@op
def my_output_op() -> Output:
    return Output("some_value")


# A single output with a parameterized type annotation
@op
def my_output_generic_op() -> Output[int]:
    return Output(5)


# Multiple outputs using parameterized type annotation
@op(out={"int_out": Out(), "str_out": Out()})
def my_multiple_generic_output_op() -> Tuple[Output[int], Output[str]]:
    return (Output(5), Output("foo"))
```

When <PyObject object="Output" /> objects are yielded, type annotations cannot be used. Instead, type information can be specified using the `out` argument of the op decorator.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_yield_outputs endbefore=end_yield_outputs
from dagster import Output, op


@op(out={"out1": Out(str), "out2": Out(int)})
def my_op_yields():
    yield Output(5, output_name="out2")
    yield Output("foo", output_name="out1")
```

#### Attaching Metadata to Outputs <Experimental/>

If there is information specific to an op output that you would like to log, you can use an <PyObject object="Output"/> object to attach metadata to the op's output. To do this, use the `metadata` parameter on the object, which expects a mapping of string labels to metadata values.

The <PyObject object="EventMetadata" /> class contains a set of static wrappers to customize the display of certain types of structured metadata.

The following example demonstrates how you might use this functionality:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_op_output_3 endbefore=end_op_output_3
from dagster import MetadataValue, Output, op


@op
def my_metadata_output(context) -> Output:
    df = get_some_data()
    return Output(
        df,
        metadata={
            "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
            "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url("http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"),
            "raw_count": len(df),
            "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
        },
    )
```

### Asset Materializations

<PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events tell Dagster that you have written
some data asset to an external system. The classic example would be writing to a
table in a database, but really any sort of persisted object that you would want
to keep track of can be considered an asset.

Generally, you'd want to send this event directly after you persist the asset to your external system. All <PyObject object="AssetMaterialization" /> events must define an `asset_key`, which is a unique identifier to describe the asset you are persisting.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_asset_op endbefore=end_asset_op
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, op


@op
def my_asset_op(context):
    df = get_some_data()
    store_to_s3(df)
    context.log_event(
        AssetMaterialization(
            asset_key="s3.my_asset",
            description="A df I stored in s3",
        )
    )

    result = do_some_transform(df)
    return result
```

Asset materializations can also be yielded:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_asset_op_yield endbefore=end_asset_op_yield
from dagster import AssetMaterialization, Output, op


@op
def my_asset_op_yields():
    df = get_some_data()
    store_to_s3(df)
    yield AssetMaterialization(
        asset_key="s3.my_asset",
        description="A df I stored in s3",
    )

    result = do_some_transform(df)
    yield Output(result)
```

When yielding asset materializations, outputs must also be yielded via an <PyObject object="Output" />.

To learn more about assets and how they are surfaced once you send this event, check out the [Asset Catalog](/concepts/dagit/dagit#assets) documentation.

#### Attaching Metadata to Asset Materializations

Attaching metadata to Asset Materializations is an important way of tracking aspects of a given asset over time. This functions essentially identically to other events which accept a `metadata` parameter, allowing you to attach a set of structured labels and values to display.

```python file=concepts/assets/materialization_ops.py startafter=start_materialization_ops_marker_2 endbefore=end_materialization_ops_marker_2
from dagster import op, AssetMaterialization, MetadataValue


@op
def my_metadata_materialization_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    remote_storage_path = persist_to_storage(df)
    context.log_event(
        AssetMaterialization(
            asset_key="my_dataset",
            description="Persisted result to storage",
            metadata={
                "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
                "path": MetadataValue.path(remote_storage_path),
                "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url(
                    "http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"
                ),
                "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
            },
        )
    )
    return remote_storage_path
```

### Asset Observations

<PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> events record metadata about assets. Unlike
asset materializations, asset observations do not signify that an asset has been
mutated.

Within ops and assets, you can log or yield <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> events at runtime. Similar to attaching metadata to asset materializations, asset observations accept a `metadata` parameter, allowing you to track specific properties of an asset over time.

```python file=/concepts/assets/observations.py startafter=start_observation_asset_marker_0 endbefore=end_observation_asset_marker_0
from dagster import AssetObservation, op


@op
def observation_op(context):
    df = read_df()
    context.log_event(
        AssetObservation(asset_key="observation_asset", metadata={"num_rows": len(df)})
    )
    return 5
```

In the example above, an observation tracks the number of rows in an asset persisted to storage. This information can then be viewed on the [Asset Details](/concepts/dagit/dagit#asset-details) page.

To learn more about asset observations, check out the [Asset Observation](/concepts/assets/asset-observations) documentation.

### Expectation Results

Ops can emit structured events to represent the results of a data quality test. The data quality event class is the <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" />. To generate an expectation result, we can log or yield an <PyObject object="ExpectationResult" /> event in our op.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_expectation_op endbefore=end_expectation_op
from dagster import ExpectationResult, op


@op
def my_expectation_op(context, df):
    do_some_transform(df)
    context.log_event(
        ExpectationResult(success=len(df) > 0, description="ensure dataframe has rows")
    )
    return df
```

#### Attaching Metadata to Expectation Results

Like many other event types in Dagster, there are a variety of types of metadata that can be associated with an expectation result event, all through the <PyObject object="MetadataEntry"/> class. Each expectation event optionally takes a list of metadata entries that are then displayed in the event log.

This example shows metadata entries of different types attached to the same expectation result:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_metadata_expectation_op endbefore=end_metadata_expectation_op
from dagster import ExpectationResult, MetadataValue, op


@op
def my_metadata_expectation_op(context, df):
    df = do_some_transform(df)
    context.log_event(
        ExpectationResult(
            success=len(df) > 0,
            description="ensure dataframe has rows",
            metadata={
                "text_metadata": "Text-based metadata for this event",
                "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url(
                    "http://mycoolsite.com/url_for_my_data"
                ),
                "raw_count": len(df),
                "size (bytes)": calculate_bytes(df),
            },
        )
    )
    return df
```

## Exceptions

Dagster also provides some op-specific exception classes, which can be raised to halt the execution of a op. The behavior after an exception is raised depends on the exception that you use. The exceptions are documented below.

### Failures

<PyObject object="Failure" /> exceptions may be raised to indicate that an op has
failed in an unrecoverable way, and that execution should stop. This may be useful
if, in the body of your op, you detect an issue that would not raise an error on
its own, but would still cause problems if the execution were to continue.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_failure_op endbefore=end_failure_op
from dagster import Failure, op


@op
def my_failure_op():
    path = "/path/to/files"
    my_files = get_files(path)
    if len(my_files) == 0:
        raise Failure(
            description="No files to process",
            metadata={
                "filepath": MetadataValue.path(path),
                "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url("http://mycoolsite.com/failures"),
            },
        )
    return some_calculation(my_files)
```

#### Attaching Metadata to Failures

As is the case with many Dagster-provided classes, you can attach a list <PyObject object="MetadataEntry"/> denoting an arbitrary set of metadata relevant to the failure.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_failure_metadata_op endbefore=end_failure_metadata_op
from dagster import Failure, op


@op
def my_failure_metadata_op():
    path = "/path/to/files"
    my_files = get_files(path)
    if len(my_files) == 0:
        raise Failure(
            description="No files to process",
            metadata={
                "filepath": MetadataValue.path(path),
                "dashboard_url": MetadataValue.url("http://mycoolsite.com/failures"),
            },
        )
    return some_calculation(my_files)
```

### Retry Requests

<PyObject object="RetryRequested" /> exceptions are useful when you experience failures
that are possible to recover from. For example, if you have a flaky operation that
you expect to throw an exception once in a while, you can catch the exception and
throw a <PyObject object="RetryRequested" /> to make Dagster halt and re-start op
execution.

You can configure the number of retries to be attempted with the `max_retries` parameter.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/op_events.py startafter=start_retry_op endbefore=end_retry_op
from dagster import RetryRequested, op


@op
def my_retry_op():
    try:
        result = flaky_operation()
    except Exception as e:
        raise RetryRequested(max_retries=3) from e
    return result
```
