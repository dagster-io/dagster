# Table metadata

Table metadata provides additional context about a tabular asset, such as its schema, row count, and more. This metadata can be used to improve collaboration, debugging, and data quality in your data platform.

Dagster supports attaching different types of table metadata to assets, including:

- [**Column schema**](#attaching-column-schema), which describes the structure of the table, including column names and types
- [**Row count**](#attaching-row-count), which describes the number of rows in a materialized table
- [**Column-level lineage**](#attaching-column-level-lineage), which describes how a column is created and used by other assets

## Attaching column schema

### For assets defined in Dagster

Column schema metadata can be attached to Dagster assets either as [definition metadata](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata#attaching-definition-metadata) or [materialization metadata](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata#attaching-materialization-metadata), which will then be visible in the Dagster UI. For example:

<Image
alt="Column schema for an asset in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/metadata-tags/metadata-table-schema.png"
width={1793}
height={652}
/>

If the schema of your asset is pre-defined, you can attach it as definition metadata. If the schema is only known when an asset is materialized, you can attach it as metadata to the materialization.

To attach schema metadata to an asset, you will need to:

1. Construct a <PyObject object="TableSchema"/> object with <PyObject object="TableColumn"  /> entries describing each column in the table
2. Attach the `TableSchema` object to the asset as part of the `metadata` parameter under the `dagster/column_schema` key. This can be attached to your asset definition, or to the <PyObject object="MaterializeResult" /> object returned by the asset function.

Below are two examples of how to attach column schema metadata to an asset, one as definition metadata and one as materialization metadata:

```python file=/concepts/metadata-tags/asset_column_schema.py
from dagster import AssetKey, MaterializeResult, TableColumn, TableSchema, asset


# Definition metadata
# Here, we know the schema of the asset, so we can attach it to the asset decorator
@asset(
    deps=[AssetKey("source_bar"), AssetKey("source_baz")],
    metadata={
        "dagster/column_schema": TableSchema(
            columns=[
                TableColumn(
                    "name",
                    "string",
                    description="The name of the person",
                ),
                TableColumn(
                    "age",
                    "int",
                    description="The age of the person",
                ),
            ]
        )
    },
)
def my_asset(): ...


# Materialization metadata
# Here, the schema isn't known until runtime
@asset(deps=[AssetKey("source_bar"), AssetKey("source_baz")])
def my_other_asset():
    column_names = ...
    column_types = ...

    columns = [
        TableColumn(name, column_type)
        for name, column_type in zip(column_names, column_types)
    ]

    yield MaterializeResult(
        metadata={"dagster/column_schema": TableSchema(columns=columns)}
    )
```

The schema for `my_asset` will be visible in the Dagster UI.

### For assets loaded from integrations

Dagster's dbt integration enables automatically attaching column schema metadata to assets loaded from dbt models. Refer to the [dbt documentation](/integrations/dbt/reference#fetching-column-level-metadata) for more information.

## Attaching row count

Row count metadata can be attached to Dagster assets as [materialization metadata](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata#attaching-materialization-metadata) to provide additional context about the number of rows in a materialized table. This will be highlighted in the Dagster UI. For example:

<Image
alt="Row count for an asset in the Dagster UI"
src="/images/concepts/metadata-tags/metadata-row-count.png"
width={1921}
height={559}
/>

In addition to showing the latest row count, Dagster will let you track changes in the row count over time, and you can use this information to monitor data quality.

To attach row count metadata to an asset, you will need to attach a numerical value to the `dagster/row_count` key in the metadata parameter of the <PyObject object="MaterializeResult" /> object returned by the asset function. For example:

```python file=/concepts/metadata-tags/asset_row_count.py
import pandas as pd

from dagster import AssetKey, MaterializeResult, asset


@asset(deps=[AssetKey("source_bar"), AssetKey("source_baz")])
def my_asset():
    my_df: pd.DataFrame = ...

    yield MaterializeResult(metadata={"dagster/row_count": 374})
```

## Attaching column-level lineage

Column lineage enables data and analytics engineers alike to understand how a column is created and used in your data platform. Refer to the [Column-level lineage documentation](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata/column-level-lineage) for more information.

---

## Ensuring table schema consistency

When column schemas are defined at runtime through materialization metadata, it can be helpful to detect and alert on schema changes between materializations. Dagster provides <PyObject object="build_column_schema_change_checks"/> API to help detect these changes.

This function creates asset checks which compare the current materialization's schema against the schema from the previous materialization. These checks can detect:

- Added columns
- Removed columns
- Changed column types

Let's define a column schema change check for our asset from the example above that defines table schema at runtime, `my_other_asset`.

```python file=/concepts/metadata-tags/schema_change_checks.py startafter=start_check endbefore=end_check
from dagster import build_column_schema_change_checks

schema_checks = build_column_schema_change_checks(assets=[my_other_asset])
```

If any schema changes are detected between materializations, they will be reported in the asset's check results in the Dagster UI. This can help catch unexpected schema changes and prevent downstream issues.

### Alerting on schema change (Dagster+ only)

In Dagster+, you can set up alerts to notify you when assets have had a schema change. By default, schema change checks will fail with a severity of `WARN`, but you can override this to fail with `ERROR`.

To alert on schema changes, create an alert policy with the following settings:

<AssetCheckAlerts />
