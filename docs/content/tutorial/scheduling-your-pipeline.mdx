# Tutorial, part five: Scheduling your pipeline

Now that you've written an entire pipeline in Dagster, you will need to run it regularly to keep your assets up to date.

By the end of this part of the tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Structure your project with code locations
- Refresh your assets periodically with schedules

---

## Step 1: Scheduling the materializations

A schedule's responsibility is to launch runs that target a set of assets (or job) at a specified time. Schedules are created with the <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> class.

Dagster's <PyObject object="AssetSelection"/> lets you specify a set of assets to target with a schedule. In the example below, <PyObject object="AssetSelection" method="all"/> selects all assets.

To regularly update the assets, add the new <PyObject object="ScheduleDefinition" /> import, create a new schedule that targets `AssetSelection.all()`, and add the schedule to the code location. The code below is how your `definitions.py` should look after making these changes:

```python file=/tutorial/scheduling/with_schedule/with_schedule.py
from dagster import (
    AssetSelection,
    Definitions,
    ScheduleDefinition,
    load_assets_from_modules,
)

from . import assets

all_assets = load_assets_from_modules([assets])

# Addition: a ScheduleDefinition targeting all assets and a cron schedule of how frequently to run it
hackernews_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    name="hackernews_schedule",
    target=AssetSelection.all(),
    cron_schedule="0 * * * *",  # every hour
)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=all_assets,
    schedules=[hackernews_schedule],
)
```

Go to the UI, click **Automation**, and observe your new schedule.

To test the change, click the schedule's name to view its details. Click the **Test Schedule** button on the top right corner of the page to trigger the schedule immediately.

### Other ways to automate your pipelines

You've used a schedule to update your data on a regular cadence. However, there are other ways to automatically trigger updates. For example, sensors can launch runs after routinely polling a source. Check out the [Automation guide](/concepts/automation) to learn more.

### About definitions

Up until this point, you defined assets using the <PyObject object="asset" decorator /> decorator. Dagster definitions are entities that Dagster learns about by importing your code. Just now, you used a different kind of definition: a job definition.

Managing one type of definition, such as assets, is easy. However, it can quickly become unruly as your project grows to have a variety of definitions (ex. schedules, jobs, sensors). To combine definitions and have them aware of each other, Dagster provides a utility called the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object.

## Next steps

By now, you've:

- Grouped your objects with a code location
- Defined a schedule that targets all assets in your code location
- Tested the schedule to ensure it works as expected

In the next section, you'll learn how to build more robustness, reusability, and flexibility when [connecting to external services](/tutorial/connecting-to-external-services) by using resources.
