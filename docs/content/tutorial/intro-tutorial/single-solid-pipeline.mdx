# A Single-Solid Pipeline

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/" />

## Solids and Pipelines

Dagster's core abstractions are **[solids](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids)** and **[pipelines](/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipelines)**.

**[Solids](/concepts/solids-pipelines/solids)** are individual units of computation that we wire together to form **[pipelines](/concepts/solids-pipelines/pipelines)**. By default, all solids in a pipeline execute in the same process. In production environments, Dagster is usually configured so that each solid executes in its own process.

In this section, we'll cover how to define a simple pipeline with a single solid, and then execute it.

## The Cereal Dataset

Our pipeline will operate on a simple but scary CSV dataset, cereal.csv, which contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast cereals.

## Hello, Solid!

Let's write our first Dagster solid and save it as `hello_cereal.py`.

A solid is a unit of computation in a data pipeline. Typically, you'll define solids by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="solid" displayText="@solid" /> decorator.

Our first solid does three things: downloads a csv of cereal data, reads it into a list of dictionaries which each represent a row in the CSV, and logs the number of rows it finds.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_solid_marker endbefore=end_solid_marker
import requests
import csv
from dagster import pipeline, solid


@solid
def hello_cereal(context):
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereals = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]
    context.log.info(f"Found {len(cereals)} cereals")

    return cereals
```

In this simple case, our solid takes no arguments except for the <PyObject module="dagster"
object="SolidExecutionContext" displayText="context" /> in which it executes (provided by the Dagster framework as the first argument to solids who specify it), and returns the rows of the file. Don't worry, we'll soon encounter solids that are much more dynamic.

## Hello, Pipeline!

To execute our solid, we'll embed it in an equally simple pipeline. A pipeline is a set of solids arranged into a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computation. You'll typically define pipelines by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject
module="dagster" object="pipeline" displayText="@pipeline" /> decorator.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_marker
@pipeline
def hello_cereal_pipeline():
    hello_cereal()
```

Here you'll see that we call `hello_cereal()`. This call doesn't actually execute the solid. Within the bodies of functions decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="pipeline"
displayText="@pipeline" />, we use function calls to indicate the dependency structure of the solids making up the pipeline. Here, we indicate that the execution of `hello_cereal` doesn't depend on any other solids by calling it with no arguments.

## Executing Our First Pipeline

Assuming you’ve saved this pipeline as `hello_cereal.py`, you can execute it via any of three different mechanisms:

### Dagit

To visualize your pipeline (which only has one node) in Dagit, from the directory in which you've saved the pipeline file, just run:

```bash
dagit -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see output like

```bash
Loading repository... Serving on http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000/pipeline/hello_cereal_pipeline/> in your web browser and view your pipeline. It isn't very interesting yet, because it only has one node.

<Image
alt="hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

Click on the "Playground" tab and you'll see the view below.

<Image
alt="hello_cereal_figure_two.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_two.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

The large upper left pane is empty here, but, in pipelines with parameters, this is where you'll be able to edit pipeline configuration on the fly.

Click the "Launch Execution" button on the bottom right to execute this plan directly from Dagit. A new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1—or, just navigate to the "Runs" tab to see this, and every run of your pipeline.

<Image
alt="hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
width={1680}
height={946}
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to your pipeline run.

### Dagster CLI

From the directory in which you've saved the pipeline file, just run:

```bash
dagster pipeline execute -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see the full stream of events emitted by Dagster appear in the console, including our call to the logging machinery, which will look like:

```bash
2021-02-05 08:50:25 - dagster - INFO - system - ce5d4576-2569-44ff-a14a-51010eea5329 - hello_cereal - Found 77 cereals
```

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather execute your pipelines as a script, you can do that without using the Dagster CLI at all. Just add a few lines to `hello_cereal.py`

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
from dagster import execute_pipeline

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = execute_pipeline(hello_cereal_pipeline)
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python hello_cereal.py
```

The <PyObject module="dagster" object="execute_pipeline" displayText="execute_pipeline()" /> function called here is the core Python API for executing Dagster pipelines from code.
