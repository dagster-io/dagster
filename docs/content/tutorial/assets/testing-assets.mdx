# Testing Assets

Creating testable and verifiable data pipelines is one of the focuses of Dagster. We believe ensuring data quality is critical for managing the complexity of data systems. Here, we'll cover how to write unit tests for individual assets, as well as for graphs of assets together.

## Testing the Cereal Asset Definitions

Let's go back to the assets we defined in the [prior section](/tutorial/assets/asset-graph#a-more-complex-asset-graph), and ensure that they work as expected by writing some unit tests.

We'll start by writing a test for the `nabisco_cereals` asset definition, which filters the larger list of cereals down to the those that were manufactured by Nabisco. To run the function that derives an asset from its upstream dependencies, we can invoke it directly, as if it's a regular Python function:

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/complex_asset_graph_tests.py startafter=start_asset_test endbefore=end_asset_test
def test_nabisco_cereals():
    cereals = [
        {"name": "cereal1", "mfr": "N"},
        {"name": "cereal2", "mfr": "K"},
    ]
    result = nabisco_cereals(cereals)
    assert len(result) == 1
    assert result == [{"name": "cereal1", "mfr": "N"}]
```

We'll also write a test for all the assets together. To do that, we need to combine them into an <PyObject object="AssetGroup" />. Then, we can invoke <PyObject object="AssetGroup" method="materialize_in_process" />, which returns an <PyObject module="dagster" object="ExecuteInProcessResult" />, whose methods let us investigate, in detail, the success or failure of execution, the values produced by the computation, and (as we'll see later) other events associated with execution.

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/complex_asset_graph_tests.py startafter=start_asset_group_test endbefore=end_asset_group_test
from dagster import AssetGroup


def test_cereal_asset_group():
    group = AssetGroup(
        [
            nabisco_cereals,
            cereals,
            cereal_protein_fractions,
            highest_protein_nabisco_cereal,
        ]
    )

    result = group.materialize()
    assert result.success
    assert result.output_for_node("highest_protein_nabisco_cereal") == "100% Bran"
```

Now you can use pytest, or your test runner of choice, to run the unit tests.

```bash
pytest test_complex_asset_graph.py
```

Dagster is written to make testing easy in a domain where it has historically been very difficult. You can learn more about Testing in Dagster by reading the [Testing](/concepts/testing) page.

## Conclusion

🎉 Congratulations! Having reached this far, you now have a working, testable, and maintainable group of software-defined assets.
