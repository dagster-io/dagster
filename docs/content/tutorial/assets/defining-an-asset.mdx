# A First Asset

## The Cereal Dataset

Our assets will represent and transform a simple but scary CSV dataset, `cereal.csv`, which contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast cereals.

## Hello, Asset!

Let's write our first Dagster asset and save it as `cereal.py`.

A software-defined asset specifies an asset that you want to exist and how to compute its contents. Typically, you'll define assets by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="asset" decorator /> decorator.

Our first asset represents a dataset of cereal data, downloaded from the internet.

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/cereal.py startafter=start_asset_marker endbefore=end_asset_marker
import csv
import requests
from dagster import asset


@asset
def cereals():
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereal_rows = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]

    return cereal_rows
```

In this simple case, our asset doesn't depend on any other assets.

## Materializing our asset

Materializing an asset means computing its contents and then writing them to persistent storage. By default, Dagster will pickle the value returned by the function and store it in the local filesystem, using the name of the asset as the name of the file. Where and how the contents are stored is fully customizable - e.g. you might store them in a database or a cloud object store like S3. We'll look at how that works later.

Assuming you’ve saved this code as `cereal.py`, you can execute it via two different mechanisms:

### Dagit

To visualize your assets in Dagit, run the following command. Make sure you're in the directory that contains the file with your code:

```bash
dagit -f cereal.py
```

You'll see output similar to:

```bash
Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your web browser and view your asset.

<Image

src="/images/guides/asset-tutorial/defining_an_asset.png"
width={1331}

/>

Click the **Materialize** button to launch a run that materializes the asset. After the run completes, the **Activity** tab on the **Assets** page will contain information about the run.

Click the run ID in the **Activity** tab to view details about the run. A page including a structured stream of logs and events that occurred during the run will display:

<Image
alt="Asset run"
src="/images/guides/asset-tutorial/asset_run.png"
width={1331}
height={874}
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to the run that's materializing your asset.

Click the **cereals** link in the upper left corner of the page - next to the **Success** indicator in the image below - to navigate back to the **Asset details** page:

<Image
alt="Asset details"
src="/images/guides/asset-tutorial/asset_details.png"
width={1331}
height={874}
/>

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather materialize your asset as a script, you can do that without spinning up Dagit. Just add a few lines to `cereal.py`. This executes a run within the Python process.

```python file=/guides/dagster/asset_tutorial/cereal.py startafter=start_materialize_marker endbefore=end_materialize_marker
from dagster import materialize

if __name__ == "__main__":
    materialize([cereals])
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python cereal.py
```
