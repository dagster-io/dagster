title: Create a New Project | Dagster
description: Dagster comes with a convenient CLI command for creating a new project. This guide explains the role of each generated file and directory.

# Create a New Project

The easiest way to start building a Dagster project is by using the `dagster project` CLI. This CLI tool helps generate files and folder structures that enable you to quickly get started with Dagster. You can scaffold a new project [using the default project skeleton](#option-1-starting-with-the-default-project-skeleton), or [start with using one of the official Dagster examples](#option-2-starting-with-an-official-example).

---

## Option 1: Starting with the default project skeleton

To get started, you can run:

```bash
pip install dagster
dagster project scaffold --name my-dagster-project
```

The command `dagster project scaffold` generates a folder structure with a single Dagster repository and other boilerplate files such as [`workspace.yaml`](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces). This helps you to quickly start with an empty project with everything set up.

Here's a breakdown of the files and directories that are generated:

| File/Directory              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `my_dagster_project/`       | A Python package that contains code for your new Dagster repository.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `my_dagster_project_tests/` | A Python package that contains tests for `my_dagster_project`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `workspace.yaml`            | A file that specifies the location of your code for Dagit and the Dagster CLI. Check out [Workspaces](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/workspaces) for more details.                                                                                                                                 |
| `README.md`                 | A description and starter guide for your new Dagster project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `pyproject.toml`            | A file that specifies package core metadata in static, tool-agnostic way. <br /> Note: `pyproject.toml` was introduced in [PEP-518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) and meant to replace `setup.py`, but we may still include a `setup.py` for compatibility with tools that do not use this spec. |
| `setup.py`                  | A build script with Python package dependencies for your new project as a package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `setup.cfg`                 | An int file that contains option defaults for `setup.py` commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Inside of the directory `my_dagster_project/`, the following files and directories are generated:

| File/Directory                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `my_dagster_project/repository.py` | A Python module that contains a <PyObject object="RepositoryDefinition" />, to specify which assets, jobs, schedules, and sensors are available in your repository.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `my_dagster_project/assets/`       | A Python package that contains all the [Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets). It is helpful to include all assets in a subpackage so that you can use <PyObject object="load_assets_from_package_module" /> to load assets into your repository, rather than needing to add assets to the repository every time you define one. |

## Option 2: Starting with an official example

Alternatively, you can start with one of the official Dagster examples.

To get started, you can run:

```bash
pip install dagster
dagster project from-example \
  --name my-dagster-project \
  --example project_fully_featured
```

The command `dagster project from-example` downloads one of the official Dagster examples to the current directory. This command enables you to quickly bootstrap your project with an officially maintained example.

For more info about the examples, visit the [Dagster GitHub repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples) or use `dagster project list-examples`.

---

## Getting started

The newly generated `my-dagster-project` directory is a fully functioning [Python package](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) and can be installed with `pip`. To install it as a package and its Python dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

<Note>
  By using the <code>--editable</code> flag, <code>pip</code> will install your
  repository in{" "}
  <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/local-project-installs/#editable-installs">
    "editable mode"
  </a>{" "}
  so that as you develop, local code changes will automatically apply.
</Note>

Then, start the Dagit web server:

```bash
dagit
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the project.

Now, you can start writing assets in `my_dagster_project/assets/`, define your own ops or jobs and include them in `my_dagster_project/repository.py`.

---

## Development

### Adding new Python dependencies

You can specify new Python dependencies in `setup.py`.

### Unit testing

Tests can be added in the `my_dagster_project_tests` directory and you can run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest my_dagster_project_tests_tests
```

### Schedules and sensors

If you want to enable Dagster [Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or [Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), you will need to start a [Dagster Daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon).

Start a daemon process in the same folder as your `workspace.yaml` file, but in a different shell or terminal:

```bash
dagster-daemon run
```

<Note>

The `$DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable must be set to a directory for the daemon to work. Note: using directories within `/tmp/` may cause issues. See <Link href="/deployment/dagster-instance#default-local-behavior">Dagster Instance default local behavior</Link> for more details.

</Note>
Once your daemon process is running, you can start turning on schedules and sensors for your jobs.

## Deployment

Once your project is ready to move to production, check out our recommendation for [Transitioning Data Pipelines from Development to Production](/guides/dagster/transitioning-data-pipelines-from-development-to-production).

Visit the [Deployment Guides](/deployment) to learn more how to run Dagster in production environments, such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EC2, etc.
