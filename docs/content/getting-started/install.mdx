## Installing Dagster

To install Dagster and Dagit into an existing Python environment, run:

```bash
pip install dagster dagit
```

This will install the latest stable version of the core Dagster packages in your current Python environment.

**Note for Macs with an M1 or M2 chip**: Some users have reported installation errors due to missing wheels for arm64 Macs when installing the `grpcio` package. You can avoid these errors by installing `dagster` using our pre-built wheel of the `grpcio` package for M1 and M2 machines:

```bash
pip install dagster dagit --find-links=https://github.com/dagster-io/build-grpcio/wiki/Wheels
```

## Python version and environment

<!-- Lives in: /next/components/mdx/includes/dagster/DagsterVersion.mdx -->

<DagsterVersion />

To check that Python and the pip package manager are already installed in your environment, you can run:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

We strongly recommend installing Dagster inside a Python virtualenv. If you are running Anaconda, you should install Dagster inside a Conda environment.

If you would like to install Dagster from source, please see the section on [Contributing](/community/contributing).
