# Dagster Cloud agents

Dagster Cloud uses an agent that is responsible for executing your code. The agent streams metadata about code execution over HTTPS to Dagster Cloud’s Agent API.

In this guide, we'll cover:

- [The agents Dagster Cloud supports](#supported-agents)
- [Resources for customizing your agent](#customizing-agents)

---

## Supported agents

Dagster Cloud currently supports agents running on the following backends:

- [Local](#local-agent)
- [Kubernetes](#kubernetes-agent)
- [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](#amazon-ecs-agent)
- [Docker](#docker-agent)

### Local agent

The local agent executes Dagster jobs as processes on your computer. Refer to the [setup guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/local) for more info.

### Kubernetes agent

The Kubernetes agent executes Dagster jobs on a Kubernetes cluster. This agent is appropriate for scaled production deployments and is a good choice for teams who have already standardized on Kubernetes. Refer to the [setup guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent) for more info.

**Already set up a Kubernetes agent?** Refer to the [Kubernetes agent configuration reference](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuration-reference) for info about configuration options.

### Amazon ECS agent

The Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) agent executes Dagster jobs as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Fargate ECS tasks. This agent is appropriate for scaled production deployments; ECS is a good choice for teams who have already standardized on ECS or who don't plan to run their own container orchestration infrastructure.

There are three ways you can create an Amazon ECS agent:

- [**In a new VPC, using our CloudFormation template**](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-new-vpc) - **Recommended**. This option spins up the ECS agent from scratch, creating a new VPC and ECS cluster for the agent to run in.
- [**In an existing VPC, using our CloudFormation template**](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-existing-vpc) - This option spins up the ECS agent stack in an existing VPC, using a new or existing ECS cluster.
- [**Manually provisioning the agent**](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/manually-provisioning-ecs-agent) - Manual provision is the most customizable option, but also the most advanced.

**Already used our CloudFormation template?** Refer to the [Upgrading CloudFormation for Amazon ECS guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/upgrading-cloudformation-template) for info about upgrading your ECS agent's template.

### Docker agent

The Docker agent executes Dagster jobs in Docker containers on your computer. Refer to the [setup guide](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker) for more info.
