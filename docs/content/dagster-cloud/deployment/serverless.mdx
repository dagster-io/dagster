# Serverless deployment in Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Dagster Cloud Serverless is a fully managed version of Dagster Cloud, and is the easiest way to get started with Dagster. With Serverless, you can run your Dagster jobs without spinning up any infrastructure.

---

## When to choose Serverless

Serverless works best with workloads that primarily orchestrate other services or perform light computation. Most workloads fit into this category, especially those that orchestrate third-party SaaS products like cloud data warehouses and ETL tools.

If any of the following are applicable, you should select [Hybrid deployment](/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid):

- You require substantial computational resources. For example, training a large machine learning (ML) model in-process.
- Your dataset is too large to fit in memory. For example, training a large machine learning (ML) model in-process on a terabyte of data.
- You need to distribute computation across many nodes for a single run. Dagster Cloud runs currently execute on a single node with 4 CPUs.
- You don't want to add Elementl as a data processor.

---

## Limitations

Serverless is currently in early access and is subject to the following limitations:

- Maximum of 100 GB of bandwidth per day
- Maximum of 4500 step-minutes per day
- Runs receive 4 vCPU cores, 16 GB of RAM and 128 GB of ephemeral disk
- Sensors receive 0.25 vCPU cores and 512 MB of RAM
- All Serverless jobs run in the United States

Enterprise customers may request a quota increase by [contacting Sales](mailto:sales@elementl.com).

## Getting started with Serverless

- [With GitHub](#with-github)
- [Without GitHub (GitLab, BitBucket, or local development)](#without-github-gitlab-bitbucket-or-local-development)
- [Adding secrets](#adding-secrets)

### With GitHub

If you are a GitHub user, our GitHub integration is the fastest way to get started. It uses a GitHub app and GitHub Actions to set up a repo containing skeleton code and configuration consistent with Dagster Cloud's best practices with a single click.

When you create a new Dagster Cloud organization, you'll be prompted to choose Serverless or Hybrid deployment. Once activated, our GitHub integration will scaffold a new git repo for you with Serverless and Branch Deployments already configured. Pushing to the `main` branch will deploy to your `prod` Serverless deployment. Pull requests will spin up ephemeral [branch deployments](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) using the Serverless agent.

### Without GitHub (GitLab, BitBucket, or local development)

If you don't want to use our GitHub integration, we offer a powerful CLI that you can use in another CI environment or on your local laptop.

First, [create a new project](https://docs.dagster.io/getting-started/create-new-project#create-a-new-project) with the Dagster open-source CLI.

```shell
pip install dagster
dagster project from-example \
  --name my-dagster-project \
  --example assets_modern_data_stack
```

<Note>
  Once scaffolded, add <code>dagster-cloud</code> as a dependency in your{" "}
  <code>setup.py</code> file.
</Note>

Next, install the [dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/dagster-cloud-cli) and log in to your org. **Note**: The CLI requires a recent version of Python 3 and Docker.

```shell
pip install dagster-cloud
dagster-cloud configure
```

You can also configure the `dagster-cloud` tool noninteractively; see [the CLI docs](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/dagster-cloud-cli#environment-variables-and-cli-options) for more information.

Finally, deploy your project with Dagster Cloud Serverless:

```shell
dagster-cloud serverless deploy-python-executable \
  --location-name example \
  --package-name assets_modern_data_stack
```

### Adding secrets

Often you'll need to securely access secrets from your jobs. Dagster Cloud supports several methods for adding secrets - refer to the [Dagster Cloud environment variables and secrets documentation](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets) for more info.

### Adding dependencies

Any dependencies specified in either `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` will be installed for you automatically by the Dagster Cloud Serverless infrastructure.

---

## Customizing the runtime environment

Dagster Cloud Serverless packages your code as [PEX](https://pex.readthedocs.io) files and deploys them on Docker images. Using PEX files significantly reduces the time to deploy since it does not require building a new Docker image and provisioning a new container for every code change. Many apps will work fine with the default Dagster Cloud Serverless setup. However, some apps may need to make changes to the runtime environment, either to include data files, use a different base image, different Python version, or install some native dependencies. You can customize the runtime environment using various methods described below.

### Including data files

To add data files to your deployment, use the [Data Files Support](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/datafiles.html) built into Python's `setup.py`. This requires adding a `package_data` or `include_package_data` keyword in the call to `setup()` in `setup.py`. For example, given this directory structure:

```
- setup.py
- my_dagster_project/
  - __init__.py
  - repository.py
  - data/
    - file1.txt
    - file2.csv
```

If you want to include the `data` folder, modify your `setup.py` to add the `package_data` line:

```python
# setup.py
from setuptools import find_packages, setup

if __name__ == "__main__":
    setup(
        name="my_dagster_project",
        packages=find_packages(exclude=["my_dagster_project_tests"]),
        # Add the following line. Here "data/*" is relative to the my_dagster_project sub directory.
        package_data={"my_dagster_project": ["data/*"]},
        install_requires=[
            "dagster",
            ...
        ],
    )
```

### Using a different Python version

The default version of Python for Serverless deployments is Python 3.8. Versions 3.7, 3.9 and 3.10 are also supported. You can specify the version you want by updating your GitHub workflow or using the `--python-version` command line argument:

- **With GitHub**: Change the `python_version` parameter for the `build_deploy_python_executable` job in your `.github/workflows` files. For example:
```yaml
      - name: Build and deploy Python executable
        if: env.ENABLE_FAST_DEPLOYS == 'true'
        uses: dagster-io/dagster-cloud-action/actions/build_deploy_python_executable@pex-v0.1
        with:
          dagster_cloud_file: "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/project-repo/dagster_cloud.yaml"
          build_output_dir: "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/build"
          python_version: "3.9"   # Change this value to the desired Python version
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- **With the CLI**: Add the `--python-version` CLI argument to the deploy command to specify the registry path to the desired base image:

  ```shell
  dagster-cloud serverless deploy --location-name=my_location --python-version=3.9
  ```

### Using a different base image or using native dependencies

Dagster Cloud runs your code on a Docker image that we build as follows:
1. The standard Python "slim" [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/python), such as `python:3.8-slim` is used as the base.
2. The `dagster-cloud[serverless]` module installed in the image.

As far as possible, add all dependencies by including the corresponding native Python bindings in your `setup.py`. When that is not possible, you can build and upload a custom base image that will be used to run your Python code. 

To build and upload the image, use the command line:

1. Build your Docker image using `docker build` or your usual Docker toolchain. Ensure the `dagster-cloud[serverless]` dependency is included. You can do this by adding the following to your `Dockerfile`: 

   ```shell
   RUN pip install "dagster-cloud[serverless]"
   ```


2. Upload your Docker image to Dagster Cloud using the `upload-base-image` command. Note that this command prints out the tag used in Dagster Cloud to identify your image:

  ```shell
  $ dagster-cloud serverless upload-base-image local-image:tag

  ...
  To use the uploaded image run: dagster-cloud deploy-python-executable ... --base-image-tag=sha256_518ad2f92b078c63c60e89f0310f13f19d3a1c7ea9e1976d67d59fcb7040d0d6
  ```

3. To use a Docker image you have published to Dagster Cloud, use the `--base-image-tag` tag printed out by the above command.

  - **With GitHub**: Set the `SERVERLESS_BASE_IMAGE_TAG` environment variable your GitHub Actions configuration (usually at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):

    ```yaml
    env:
      DAGSTER_CLOUD_URL: ...
      DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN: ...
      SERVERLESS_BASE_IMAGE: "sha256_518ad2f92b078c63c60e89f0310f13f19d3a1c7ea9e1976d67d59fcb7040d0d6"
    ```

  - **With the CLI**: Add the `--base-image-tag` CLI argument to the deploy command:

    ```shell
    dagster-cloud serverless deploy-python-executable \
      --location-name example \
      --package-name assets_modern_data_stack \
      --base-image-tag sha256_518ad2f92b078c63c60e89f0310f13f19d3a1c7ea9e1976d67d59fcb7040d0d6
    ```

## Transitioning to Hybrid

If your organization begins to hit the limitations of Serverless, you should transition to a Hybrid deployment. Hybrid deployments allow you to run an [agent in your own infrastructure](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents) and give you substantially more flexibility and control over the Dagster environment.

To switch to Hybrid, navigate to **Status > Agents** in your Dagster Cloud account. On this page, you can disable the Serverless agent on and view instructions for enabling Hybrid.

---

## Security and data protection

Unlike Hybrid, Serverless Deployments on Dagster Cloud require direct access to your data, secrets and source code.

- Dagster Cloud Serverless does not provide persistent storage. Ephemeral storage is deleted when a run concludes.
- Secrets and source code are built into the image directly. Images are stored in a per-customer container registry with restricted access.
- User code is securely sandboxed using modern container sandboxing techniques.
- All production access is governed by industry-standard best practices which are regularly audited.
