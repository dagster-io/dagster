# Configuring and running a Docker agent

<Note>
  This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

In this guide, you'll configure and run a Docker agent. Docker agents are used to launch your code in Docker containers.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Permissions in Dagster Cloud that allow you to manage agent tokens**. Refer to the [User permissions documentation](/auth#role-based-access-controls) for more info.
- **To have Docker installed**
- **Access to a container registry to which you can push images with Dagster code.** Additionally, your Docker agent must have the permissions required to pull images from the registry.

  This can be:

  - A self-hosted registry,
  - A public registry such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), or
  - A managed offering such as [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), [Azure CR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/#overview), or [Google CR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)

## Step 1: Generate a Dagster Cloud agent token

<!-- <GenerateAgentToken /> -->

---

## Step 2: Create and configure a Docker network

1. Create a Docker network for your agent:

   ```shell
   docker network create dagster_cloud_agent
   ```

2. Create a `dagster.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   instance_class:
     module: dagster_cloud.instance
     class: DagsterCloudAgentInstance

   dagster_cloud_api:
     agent_token: <YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN>
     deployment: prod

   user_code_launcher:
     module: dagster_cloud.workspace.docker
     class: DockerUserCodeLauncher
     config:
       networks:
         - dagster_cloud_agent
   ```

3. In the file, fill in the following:

   - `agent_token` - Add the agent token you created in [Step 1](#step-1-generate-a-dagster-cloud-agent-token)
   - `deployment` - Enter the deployment associated with this instance of the agent.

     In the above example, we specified `prod` as the deployment. This is present when Dagster Cloud organizations are first created.

4. Save the file.

---

## Step 3: Start the agent

Next, you'll start the agent as a container. Run the following command in the same folder as your `dagster.yaml` file:

```shell
docker run \
  --network=dagster_cloud_agent \
  --volume $PWD/dagster.yaml:/opt/dagster/app/dagster.yaml:ro \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --restart on-failure \
  -it docker.io/dagster/dagster-cloud-agent:latest \
  dagster-cloud agent run /opt/dagster/app
```

This command:

- Starts the agent with your local `dagster.yaml` mounted as a volume
- Starts the system Docker socket mounted as a volume, allowing the agent to launch containers. The `--restart-on-failure` argument will ensure that if it fails, Docker will restart it.

To view the agent in Dagster Cloud, navigate to the **Status** page and click the **Agents** tab. You should see the agent running in the **Agent statuses** section:

<Image
alt="Instance Status"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/agents/dagster-cloud-instance-status.png"

height={320}
/>

## Next steps

Now that you've got your agent running, what's next?

- **If you're getting Dagster Cloud set up**, the next step is to [add a code location](/tutorial/adding-code-locations) using the agent.

- **If you're ready to load your Dagster code**, refer to the [Adding Code to Dagster Cloud](/guides/adding-code) guide for more info.
