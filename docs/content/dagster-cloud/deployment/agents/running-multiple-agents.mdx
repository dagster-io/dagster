# Running multiple agents

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Each Dagster Cloud full deployment (e.g., `prod`) needs to have at least one agent running. A single agent is adequate for many use cases, but you may want to run multiple agents to provide redundancy if a single agent goes down.

It's recommended to only use multiple agents of the same type (e.g. multiple Kubernetes agents).

---

## Multiple agents in the same environment

If you want to run multiple agents in the same environment (e.g., multiple Kubernetes agents in the same namespace), you can set the number of replicas in the configuration for your particular agent type:

### In Docker

In Docker, you can set the number of replicas for a service in the `docker-compose.yaml` file if the deployment mode is set to `replicated` (which is the default):

```yaml
services:
  dagster-cloud-agent:
    ...
    deploy:
      mode: replicated
      replicas: 2
```

### In Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, the number of replicas is set in the Helm chart. You can set the number of replicas in the Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set replicas=2
```

or if using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
dagsterCloudAgent:
  ...
  replicas: 2
```

### In Amazon ECS

In Amazon ECS, the number of replicas can be set via the CloudFormation template:

```yaml
DagsterCloudAgent:
  Type: AWS::ECS::Service
  Properties:
    ...
    DesiredCount: 2
```

If using the CloudFormation template provided by Dagster, the number of replicas can be set via the `NumReplicas` parameter in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) UI.

## Multiple agents in different environments

If you want to run multiple agents in an environment where each agent can not access the others' resources (for example, multiple kubernetes namespaces or different clusters), you need to enable the `isolated_agents` option. This is supported for all agent types.

### In Docker

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolated_agents:
  enabled: true

dagster_cloud_api:
  # <your other config>
  agent_label: "My agent" # optional
```

### In Kubernetes

Add the following options to your Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set isolatedAgents.enabled=true \
    --set dagsterCloud.agentLabel="My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

Or if you're using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
isolatedAgents:
  enabled: true

dagsterCloud:
  agentLabel: "My agent" # optional, only supported on 0.13.14 and later
```

### In Amazon ECS

The `isolated_agents` option can be set as per-deployment configuration on the `dagster.yaml` file used by your agent. See the [ECS configuration reference](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/configuration-reference#per-deployment-configuration) guide for more information.

## Routing requests to specific agents

Every Dagster Cloud agent serves requests from one or more queues. By default, requests for each code location are placed on a default queue and your agent reads requests only from that default queue. This default configuration is sufficient for most use cases.

In some cases, you might want to route requests for certain code locations to specific agents. For example, you might want to route requests for one code location to an agent running in an on-premise data center but requests for all other code locations to an agent running in AWS. To route requests for a code locations to a specific agent, you can annotate the code locations with the name of a custom queue and configure an agent to serve only requests for that queue.

When configuring your code location, set an agent queue:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: data-eng-pipeline
    code_source:
      package_name: quickstart_etl
    executable_path: venvs/path/to/dataengineering_spark_team/bin/python
    agent_queue: special-queue
```

Next, configure an agent to handle your agent queue.

### In Docker

Add the following to the `dagster.yaml` file:

```yaml
agent_queues:
  include_default_queue: True # Continue to handle requests for code locations that aren't annotated with a specific queue
  additional_queues:
    - special-queue
```

### In Kubernetes

Add the following options to your Helm command:

```shell
helm upgrade \
    ...
    --set dagsterCloud.agentQueues.additionalQueues={"special-queue"}
```

Or if you're using a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
dagsterCloued
  agentQueues:
    # Continue to handle requests for code locations that aren't
    # assigned to a specific agent queue
    includeDefaultQueue: true
    additionalQueues:
      - special-queue
```
