# Dagster Cloud Insights (Experimental)

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

Using Dagster Cloud Insights, you can gain visibility into historical usage and cost metrics such as Dagster Cloud run duration, credit usage, and failures. You can also [integrate other metrics](#integrating-other-metrics) into the Insights UI and [export metrics from Dagster Cloud](#exporting-metrics).

## About Insights

Launched in October 2023, Insights is currently an **experimental feature.** This means we’re still collecting feedback on how Insights works and could make changes based on that feedback.

**Note**: These changes may include breaking changes to some aspects of the feature, though we will attempt to avoid it.

### Future plans

As part of the experimental release, out-of-the-box utilities for capturing external cost data are limited to Snowflake. Refer to the [Integrating other metrics section](#integrating-other-metrics) for more info.

## Accessing Insights in the Dagster UI

To access this feature, click **Insights** in the top navigation bar in the UI:

<!-- ![Viewing the Insights tab in the Dagster UI](/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-tab.png) -->

The left navigation panel on this page contains a list of [available metrics](#available-metrics). For each metric, the daily, weekly, or monthly aggregated values are displayed in the graph.

These metrics are updated on a daily basis.

## Uses

### Integrating other metrics

Other metrics, such as asset materialization metadata or Snowflake credits, can be integrated into Dagster Insights. Insights currently supports the following external metrics:

- **Asset materialization metadata.** Refer to the [Using asset metadata with Dagster Cloud Insights guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/asset-metadata) for more info.
- **Usage generated by queries made to Snowflake resources.** Refer to the [Integrating direct Snowflake usage with Dagster Cloud Insights guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/integrating-snowflake) for more info.
- **Snowflake usage generated by dbt.** Refer to the [dbt + Snowflake + Dagster Cloud Insights guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt) for more info.

### Exporting metrics

Metrics in Dagster Cloud Insights can be exported using a GraphQL API endpoint. Refer to the [Exporting Insights metrics from Dagster Cloud guide](/dagster-cloud/insights/exporting-insights-metrics) for details.
