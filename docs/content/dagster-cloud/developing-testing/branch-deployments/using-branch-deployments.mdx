# Using Branch Deployments with TODO

<Note>
	This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up [Branch Deployments](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) with a general continuous integration (CI) or git platform, using the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/guides/dagster-cloud-cli).

**If you use GitHub for version control**, check out the dedicated [Branch deployments with GitHub guide](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/using-branch-deployments-with-github).

---

## Prerequisites

Utilizing Branch Deployments requires setting up two components: the Branch Deployment agent and CI platform. You'll need:

- **Editor** or **Admin** permissions in Dagster Cloud
- To install the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/guides/dagster-cloud-cli) 
- The ability to run a new agent in your infrastructure
- The ability to configure your CI platform

---

## Step 1: Generate a Dagster Cloud agent token

In this step, you'll generate a token for the agent. The Dagster Cloud agent will use this to authenticate to the agent API.

1. Sign in to your Dagster Cloud instance.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Cloud settings**.
3. In the **Cloud settings** page, click the **Configure tokens** tab.
4. Click the **+ Create agent token** button.
5. After the token has been created, click **Reveal token**.

Keep the token somewhere handy - you'll need it to complete the setup.

## Step 2: Create and configure an agent

## Step 3: Create a branch deployment using the dagster-cloud CLI

Next, you'll create a branch deployment using the `dagster-cloud` CLI. When the state of a branch or merge request is updated, Dagster Cloud first expects these steps to occur:

1. A new image containing your code and requirements is built on the branch. For more information, see [Dagster Code Requirements](/guides/adding-code#dagster-cloud-code-requirements).

2. The new image is pushed to a Docker registry accessible to your agent. **Note**: The following examples assume the registry URL and image tag are stored in the `LOCATION_REGISTRY_URL` and `IMAGE_TAG` environment variables, respectively.

After the above has occurred:

1. Use the `dagster-cloud` CLI to create a branch deployment associated with the branch, as follows:

   ```shell
   BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(
       dagster-cloud branch-deployment create-or-update \
           --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
           --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \ # Agent token from Step 1
           --git-repo-name $REPOSITORY_NAME \ # Git repository name
           --branch-name $BRANCH_NAME \ # Git branch name
           --commit-hash $COMMIT_SHA \ # Latest commit SHA on the branch
           --timestamp $TIMESTAMP # UTC unixtime timestamp of the latest commit
   )
   ```

   One or more additional parameters can optionally be supplied to the `create-or-update` command to enhance the Branch Deployments UI in Dagster Cloud:

   ```shell
   BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(
       dagster-cloud branch-deployment create-or-update \
           --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
           --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \
           --git-repo-name $REPOSITORY_NAME \
           --branch-name $BRANCH_NAME \
           --commit-hash $COMMIT_SHA \
           --timestamp $TIMESTAMP
           --code-review-url $PR_URL \ # URL to review the given changes, e.g.
                # Pull Request or Merge Request
           --code-review-id $INPUT_PR \ # Alphanumeric ID for the given set of changes
           --pull-request-status $PR_STATUS \ # A status, one of `OPEN`, `CLOSED`,
                # or `MERGED`, that describes the set of changes
           --commit-message $MESSAGE \ # The message associated with the latest commit
           --author-name $NAME \ # A display name for the latest commit's author
           --author-email $EMAIL \ # An email for the latest commit's author
           --author-avatar-url $AVATAR_URL # An avatar URL for the latest commit's author
   )
   ```

   If the command is being executed from the context of the git repository, you can alternatively pull this metadata from the repository itself:

   ```shell
   BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=$(
       dagster-cloud branch-deployment create-or-update \
           --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
           --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \
           --git-repo-name $REPOSITORY_NAME \
           --branch-name $BRANCH_NAME \
           --read-git-state # Equivalent to passing --commit-hash, --timestamp
                            # --commit-message, --author-name, --author-email
   )
   ```

2. Deploy the code to the branch deployment:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud workspace add-location \
       --organization $ORGANIZATION_NAME \
       --deployment $BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT_NAME \
       --api-token $DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN \
       --location-file $LOCATION_FILE \
       --location-name $LOCATION_NAME \
       --image "${LOCATION_REGISTRY_URL}:${IMAGE_TAG}"
   ```

   Refer to the [Code location guide](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations) for more info on how a location's details are specified.

## Step 4: Access the branch deployment

Now that Branch Deployments are configured, you can check out the preview in Dagster Cloud.

Click the **deployment switcher** to view your workspace's branch deployments:
