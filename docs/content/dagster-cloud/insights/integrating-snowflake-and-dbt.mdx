# Integrating Snowflake + dbt with Dagster Cloud Insights

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster Cloud via an API.

If you use dbt to materialize tables in Snowflake, use this guide to integrate Snowflake metrics into the Insights UI.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster Cloud account
- Access to the [Dagster Cloud Insights feature](/dagster-cloud/insights)
- To install the following libraries:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagster-cloud dagster-dbt dagster-snowflake
  ```

  **Note**: If you already have `dagster-cloud` installed, **make sure you're using version 1.5.1 or newer**.

---

## Step 1: Instrument your dbt asset definition

First, instrument the Dagster <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_assets" decorator /> function with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights`:

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import dbt_with_snowflake_insights


@dbt_assets(...)
def my_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    # Typically you have a `yield from dbt_resource.cli(...)`.
    # Wrap the original call with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights` as below.
    dbt_cli_invocation = dbt_resource.cli(["build"], context=context)
    yield from dbt_with_snowflake_insights(context, dbt_cli_invocation)
```

This passes through all underlying events and emits an `AssetObservation` for each asset materialization. The observation contains the dbt invocation ID and unique ID that are recorded in the Dagster event log.

---

## Step 2: Update dbt_project.yml

Next, add the following to your dbt project's `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
query-comment:
  comment: "snowflake_dagster_dbt_v1_opaque_id[[[{{ node.unique_id }}:{{ invocation_id }}]]]"
  append: true
```

This allows you to add a comment to every query recorded in Snowflake's `query_history` table. The comments will contain the dbt invocation ID and unique ID.

**Note**: Make sure to include `append: true`, as Snowflake strips leading comments.

---

## Step 3: Create a metrics ingestion pipeline in Dagster

The last step is to create a Dagster pipeline that joins asset observation events with the Snowflake query history and calls the Dagster Cloud ingestion API.

To do this, you'll need a Snowflake resource (<PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="SnowflakeResource" />) that can query the `query_history` table. For example:

```python
from dagster_snowflake import SnowflakeResource
from dagster import Definition, EnvVar

from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import (
    create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule,
)

snowflake_insights_definitions = create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule(
    "2023-10-5",
    snowflake_resource_key="snowflake_insights",
)

defs = Definitions(
  assets=[..., *snowflake_insights_definitions.assets],
  schedules=[..., snowflake_insights_deifnitions.schedule],
  resources={
    ...,
    "snowflake_insights": SnowflakeResource(
      account=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_ACCOUNT"),
      user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_USER"),
      password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_PASSWORD"),
    ),
 }
)
```

In this example, the `snowflake_resource_key` is a <PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="SnowflakeResource" /> that has access to the `query_history` table.

Once the pipeline runs, Snowflake credits will be visible in the **Insights** tab in the Dagster UI:
