# Using asset metadata with Dagster Cloud Insights <Experimental />

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

Any numeric [asset materialization metadata](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#recording-materialization-metadata) attached to your assets can be viewed and aggregated in the Dagster Insights UI. This is a good way to track usage, cost, data size, or other characteristics of your data assets over time, and across different parts of your platform.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster Cloud account on the Enterprise plan
- Access to the [Dagster Cloud Insights feature](/dagster-cloud/insights)

---

## Step 1: Emit numeric values alongside your asset materializations

In order to populate Insights with materialization metadata, you must first emit numeric metadata to be aggregated.

```python file=/concepts/assets/asset_materialization_metadata_none.py
from dagster import Output, asset


@asset
def table1() -> Output[None]:
    ...  # write out some data to table1
    return Output(None, metadata={"num_rows": 25})
```

For more examples, see the [asset materialization metadata documentation](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#recording-materialization-metadata).

## Step 2: Enable viewing numeric metadata in Dagster Cloud Insights

Once one or more assets are emitting numeric metadata values, you'll be able to enable viewing them in the Insights UI. **Note**: It may take up to 24 hours for new metadata types to be reflected in the UI.

To modify the list of materialization metadata values shown in Insights, click the **Edit** button in the Insights sidebar next to the **User provided metrics** header.

In the dialog which appears, you can see a list of available metrics to check or uncheck.

Selected metrics will be immediately available to view in Insights in the sidebar and on individual asset pages.
