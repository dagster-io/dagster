# Managing teams in Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud Enterprise.</Note>

As part of our [role-based access control (RBAC) feature](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions), Dagster Cloud supports the ability to assign users to teams. A team is a group of users with a set of default deployment, code location, and Branch Deployment user roles.

In this guide, we'll cover how to add, manage, and remove teams in Dagster Cloud.

---

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, you'll need a **Dagster Cloud Enterprise plan.**

## Adding teams

<Note>
  <a href="/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions#teams">

  </a>{" "}
  are required to add teams.
</Note>

1. In the Dagster Cloud UI, click the **user menu (your icon) > Organization Settings**.
2. Click the **Teams** tab.
3. Click the **Create a team** button.

After the team is created, you can [add users and assign user roles to deployments](#managing-team-members-and-roles).

## Managing team members and roles

In the **Organization Settings > Teams** tab:

1. Locate the team you want to modify in the table of teams.
