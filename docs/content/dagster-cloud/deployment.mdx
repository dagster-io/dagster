# Dagster Cloud deployment types

Dagster Cloud currently offers two deployment options to meet your needs: Serverless and Hybrid.

---

## Serverless deployments

A Serverless deployment allows you to run Dagster jobs without spinning up any infrastructure. This fully-managed version of Dagster Cloud is the easiest way to get started with Dagster.

**Note**: Serverless is currently in early access.

## Hybrid deployments

A Hybrid deployment utilizes a combination of your infrastructure and Dagster-hosted backend services.

The Dagster backend services - including the web frontend, GraphQL API, metadata database, and daemons (responsible for executing schedules and sensors) - are hosted in Dagster Cloud.

An [agent](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents) you run in your infrastructure is responsible for executing your Dagster code.
