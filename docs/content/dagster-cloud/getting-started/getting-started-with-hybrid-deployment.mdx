# Getting Started with Dagster Cloud using a Hybrid Deployment

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

Welcome to Dagster Cloud!

In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to get up and running with Dagster Cloud using a [Hybrid Deployment](/dagster-cloud/deployment/hybrid). With a Hybrid Deployment, your Dagster code is executed in your infrastructure. Refer to the [Getting started with Serverless Deployment guide](/dagster-cloud/getting-started/getting-started-with-serverless-deployment) if you want to use Serverless.

We'll walk you through setting up your Dagster Cloud account, setting up an agent, loading your code, launching your first run, and configuring continuous integration.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Access to some Dagster code.** You can either use your own code or a [project scaffold](/getting-started/create-new-project). This guide uses a scaffold.

- **To have `dagster` and `dagster-cloud` installed**. To install, run:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagster-cloud
  ```

- **The ability to create and configure an agent in your infrastructure.** Using a Hybrid Deployment requires setting up an agent for use with Dagster Cloud. The agent runs in your infrastructure, executes your code, and streams metadata about code execution over HTTPS back to Dagster Cloud.

  Dagster Cloud supports a handful of agents, each with its own prerequisites for setup. Refer to the [Agent documentation](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents) for more info.

- For all but the local agent, you will need **access to a container registry** to store Docker images containing your Dagster code.

---

## Step 1: Create a Dagster Cloud account and organization

If you don't already have a Dagster Cloud account, [sign up for one](https://dagster.cloud/signup) before continuing.

You'll also be asked to create a Dagster Cloud organization. When your organization is created, a single deployment, named `prod`, will also be created. Deployments are standalone environments, allowing you to operate independent instances of Dagster with separately managed permissions.

---

## Step 2: Select Hybrid as your deployment type

1. When prompted, click **Select** under **Hybrid deployment**.
2. The modal that displays will contain a pre-generated [agent token](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-user-agent-tokens) and info about the agents currently supported by Dagster Cloud.
3. Follow the steps for setting up and deploying your agent:

   - [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-new-vpc)
   - [Docker](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/docker)
   - [Kubernetes](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent)
   - [Local](/dagster-cloud/deployment/agents/local)

Continue to the next step when finished.

---

## Step 3: Deploy your code

For most Hybrid deployments, with the exception of those using a local agent, you will need to create a Docker image containing your code. Then you will add a code location to Dagster Cloud that references the image. Typically, this build and deploy is done through CI/CD, but it is also possible to deploy a code location manually.

- For continunous integration using GitHub actions:

1. Begin by copying the GitHub action deploy workflow in [this repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart). 
2. Uncomment the step that is relevant to your Docker container registry.
2. Set the necessary GitHub action secrets, including your Dagster Cloud API Token and Organization ID. 

- For continuous integration using a different CI/CD provider, your system should:

 1. Build a Docker image containing your dagster code.  
 2. Push the image to a registry accessible by your agent.
 3. Deploy the update to Dagster Cloud using the `dagster-cloud` CLI. Refer to the [Adding a code location guide](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/code-locations) for more info.

- For manual code deployments, you will follow these steps:

1. In Dagster Cloud, click **Workspace**.

2. Click the **Add sample code location** button:

   <Image
   alt="Dagit Workspace Screen"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/getting-started/adding_code_location.png"
   width={1118}
   height={451}
   />

3. A pre-filled YAML editor with configuration will display.

4. Verify that the configuration is correct, then click **Add code location** to save the config.

The agent will attempt to load the your code. After the code is loaded, the new code location will show a **Loaded** status and a sample Dagster job will display in Dagster Cloud.

---

## Step 4: Launch a run

In this step, you'll run your first job in Dagster Cloud.

1. Click the icon in the top-left corner of the page to expand the navigation.
2. In the nav, open a repository and click a job.
3. On the job's page, click the **Launchpad** tab.
4. Click **Launch Run** in the bottom right corner to launch the run.

---

## Step 5: Set up Continuous Integration

Branch Deployments allow you to quickly and collaboratively develop your Dagster jobs. When a branch is created or updated in your Dagster repository, Branch Deployments will create a testing environment in the current Dagster Cloud deployment. For example, `prod`.

Check out the [Branch Deployment docs](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments) for more info. If you skip this step now, you can always set it up later.

## Next steps

Congrats - your Dagster Cloud deployment is all set up! From here, you can:

- [Invite your team](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users)
- [Configure authentication for your account](/dagster-cloud/account/authentication)
- [Set up monitoring and alerting](/dagster-cloud/account/setting-up-alerts)
- [Learn more about Branch Deployments](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments)
