# Contributing

We love to see our community members get involved! If you are planning to contribute to Dagster, you will first need to set up a local development environment.

## Environment Setup

### Apple M1-specific setup

If you have a Mac with an M1 chip, you will need to set up a separate environment to emulate an x86 architecture before following the remaining setup instructions. To find out if your Mac has an M1 chip, follow the instructions [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/706226/how-to-check-if-your-mac-is-using-an-intel-or-apple-silicon-processor/).

If you don't have a Mac with an M1 chip, skip ahead to the next section - [Dagster development setup](#dagster-development-setup).

1. Install rosetta. [About rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment).

   ```bash
   softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
   ```

2. Create a duplicate terminal that will default to running the rosetta x86 emulator. [Source stack overflow post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/428768/on-apple-m1-with-rosetta-how-to-open-entire-terminal-iterm-in-x86-64-architec).

   - Go to `Finder` > `Applications` and find your terminal app.
   - Right click the app and duplicate it.
   - Right click the new terminal > `Get Info` > `Enable Open using Rosetta`.
   - Click to open the terminal, type `arch` to verify it says `i386` now.

3. In your rosetta terminal, install `homebrew`.

   ```bash
   arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

4. To ensure that the correct installation of `homebrew` is automatically used in your rosetta terminal, add the following snippet to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc` or profile manager of choice.

   ```bash
   arch_name="$(uname -m)"

   if [ "${arch_name}" = "x86_64" ]; then
      echo "Running in x86 mode"
      eval $(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)
   elif [ "${arch_name}" = "arm64" ]; then
      echo "Running in Arm mode"
      eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
   else
      echo "Unexpected uname -m result ${arch_name}"
   fi

   # brew libraries
   export LDFLAGS="-L $(brew --prefix openssl)/lib"
   export CFLAGS="-I $(brew --prefix openssl)/include"
   ```

After sourcing this file, you can ensure that the correct version of `homebrew` is being used by confirming the output of `which brew` is `/usr/local/bin/brew`.

### Dagster development setup

1. Install Python. Python 3.6 or above recommended, but our CI/CD pipeline currently tests against up-to-date patch versions of Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.

2. Create and activate a virtualenv, using the tool of your choice. On macOS you can install `pyenv` with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv
   ```

   Then add the following commands to your shell profile:

   ```bash
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
   ```

   and finally create and activate the virtualenev:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.7.4
   pyenv virtualenv 3.7.4 dagster37
   pyenv activate dagster37
   ```

3. Ensure that you have node installed by running `node -v`, and that you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. If you are on macOS, you can install yarn with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install yarn
   ```

4. Clone the Dagster repository to the destination of your choice:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster.git
   ```

5. Run `make dev_install` at the root of the repository. This sets up a full Dagster developer environment with all modules and runs tests that do not require heavy external dependencies such as docker. This will take a few minutes. Note that certain sections of the makefile (sanity_check, which is part of rebuild_dagit) require POSIX compliant shells and will fail on CMD and powershell -- if developing on windows, using something like WSL or git-bash is recommended. Note also that if this command fails while installing python packages, the problem might be resolved by ensuring you are running an up-to-date version of `pip` (upgrade with `pip install -U pip`).

   ```bash
   make dev_install
   ```

6. Run some tests manually to make sure things are working:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest python_modules/dagster/dagster_tests
   ```

## Developing Dagster

Some notes on developing in Dagster:

- **Black/Pylint**: We use [black](https://github.com/python/black) to enforce a consistent code style, along with [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/). We test these in our CI/CD pipeline.
- **Line width**: We use a line width of 100.
- **IDE**: We recommend setting up your IDE to format with black on save and check pylint, but you can always run `make black` and `make pylint` in the root Dagster directory before submitting a pull request. If you're also using VS Code, you can see what we're using for our `settings.json` [here](https://gist.github.com/natekupp/7a17a9df8d2064e5389cc84aa118a896).
- **Docker**: Some tests require [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to be able to run them locally.

## Adding or changing public APIs

We don’t want to thrash users, so we want to be careful about changing and adding public APIs.

### What counts as a public API?

- Anything that’s importable via `from dagster import`
- Anything that’s importable via `from dagster-<subpackage> import`
- The Dagster command-line interface.

### What to do before changing, deprecating, or adding a public API

- Make an issue in Github describing the change. Some things that are helpful to include:
  - Usage examples, compared with previous state.
  - A rationale for the change.
  - A rollout timeline, including deprecation, if applicable.
- Post a link to the issue in the #proposed-api-changes channel.
- If adding an API, consider marking it “experimental”, which means it can change in point releases without warning.

### What to do after changing a public API

- Update CHANGES.md
  - Make sure to include the rationale for the change.

## Developing Dagit

For development, run the Dagit GraphQL server on a different port than the webapp, with any pipeline. For example:

```bash
cd dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/connecting_solids/
dagit -p 3333 -f complex_pipeline.py
```

Keep this running. Then, in another terminal, run the local development (autoreloading, etc.) version of the webapp:

```bash
cd dagster/js_modules/dagit
make dev_webapp
```

During development, you might find these commands useful. Run them from `dagster/js_modules/dagit`:

- `yarn ts`: Typescript typechecking
- `yarn lint`: Linting with autofix
- `yarn jest`: An interactive Jest test runner that runs only affected tests by default

To run all of them together, run `yarn test`.

## Developing docs

To run the Dagster documentation website locally, run the following commands:

```bash
cd docs
yarn --cwd next dev  # Serves the docs website on http://localhost:3001
```

Troubleshooting tip: You may need to run `yarn --cwd next` (without the `dev` command) first to install dependencies. Also make sure that your Node version is >=12.13.0.

The API documentation is generated from ReStructured Text files (`.rst`), which extracts Python docstrings from the library files. The `.rst` files can be found in the `docs/sections/api/apidocs` directory.

If you change any `.rst` files, be sure to run the following command in the `docs` directory:

```bash
make buildnext
```

## Picking a Github issue

We encourage you to start with an issue labeled with the tag [`good first issue`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) on the [Github issue board](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues), to get familiar with our codebase as a first-time contributor.

Then, you can work on the issue labeled as [`good second issue`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/labels/good%20second%20issue) which is more like a medium task.

When you are ready for more of a challenge, you can tackle issues with the [most 👍 reactions](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). We factor engagement into prioritization of the issues. You can also explore other labels and pick any issue based on your interest.
