# Contributing

We love to see our community members get involved! If you are planning to contribute to Dagster, you will first need to set up a local development environment.

## Environment setup

1. Install Python 3.8 or above.

2. Create and activate a virtualenv, using the tool of your choice. On macOS you can install `pyenv` with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv
   ```

   Then add the following commands to your shell profile:

   ```bash
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
   ```

   and finally create and activate the virtualenev:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.9.16
   pyenv virtualenv 3.9.16 dagster39
   pyenv activate dagster39
   ```

3. Ensure that you have node installed by running `node -v`, and that you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) installed. If you are on macOS, you can install yarn with Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install yarn
   ```

4. Clone the Dagster repository to the destination of your choice:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dagster-io/dagster.git
   ```

5. Run `make dev_install` at the root of the repository. This sets up a full Dagster developer environment with all modules and runs tests that do not require heavy external dependencies such as docker. This will take a few minutes. Note that certain sections of the makefile (sanity_check, which is part of `rebuild_ui`) require POSIX compliant shells and will fail on CMD and powershell -- if developing on windows, using something like WSL or git-bash is recommended. Note also that if this command fails while installing python packages, the problem might be resolved by ensuring you are running an up-to-date version of `pip` (upgrade with `pip install -U pip`).

   ```bash
   make dev_install
   ```

   **Note for Macs with an M1 or M2 chip**: Some users have reported installation problems due to missing wheels for arm64 Macs when installing the `grpcio` package. To install the `dagster` development environment using our pre-built wheel of the `grpcio` package for M1 and M2 machines, run `make dev_install_m1_grpcio_wheel` instead of `make dev_install`.

6. Run some tests manually to make sure things are working:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest python_modules/dagster/dagster_tests
   ```

## Developing Dagster

Some notes on developing in Dagster:

- **Ruff/Pyright**: We use [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for formatting, linting and import sorting, and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for static type-checking. We test these in our CI/CD pipeline.
  - Run `make ruff` from the repo root to format, sort imports, and autofix some lint errors. It will also print out errors that need to be manually fixed.
  - Run `make pyright` from the repo root to analyze the whole repo for type-correctness. Note that the first time you run this, it will take several minutes because a new virtualenv will be constructed.
- **Line Width**: We use a line width of 100.
- **IDE**: We recommend setting up your IDE to format and check with ruff on save, but you can always run `make ruff` in the root Dagster directory before submitting a pull request. If you're also using VS Code, you can see what we're using for our `settings.json` [here](https://gist.github.com/natekupp/7a17a9df8d2064e5389cc84aa118a896).
- **Docker**: Some tests require [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to be able to run them locally.

## Developing the Dagster webserver/UI

For development, run an instance of the webserver providing GraphQL service on a different port than the webapp, with any pipeline. For example:

```bash
cd dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/connecting_solids/
dagster-webserver -p 3333 -f complex_pipeline.py
```

Keep this running. Then, in another terminal, run the local development (autoreloading, etc.) version of the webapp:

```bash
cd dagster/js_modules/dagster-ui
make dev_webapp
```

During development, you might find these commands useful. Run them from `dagster/js_modules/dagster-ui`:

- `yarn ts`: Typescript typechecking
- `yarn lint`: Linting with autofix
- `yarn jest`: An interactive Jest test runner that runs only affected tests by default

To run all of them together, run `yarn test`.

## Developing Docs

The [docs style checklist](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/docs/DOC_CHECKLIST.md) includes a set of style guidelines to adhere to when adding or modifying docs.

To run the Dagster documentation website locally, run the following commands:

```bash
cd docs
make next-watch-build   # Serves the docs website on http://localhost:3001
```

Troubleshooting tip: You may need to run `make next-dev-install` first to install dependencies. Also make sure that your Node version is >=12.13.0.

The API documentation is generated from ReStructured Text files (`.rst`), which extracts Python docstrings from the library files. The `.rst` files can be found in the `docs/sphinx/sections/api/apidocs` directory.

If you change any `.rst` files, be sure to run the following command in the `docs` directory:

```bash
make apidoc-build
```

The majority of our code snippets are pulled from real Python files. This allows us to test our code snippets and ensure they remain up-to-date.

In `.mdx` files, you'll see a code snippet with `python file=/path/to/file.py startafter=start_marker endbefore=end_marker` at the beginning of the block. For example:

<Image src="/images/community/md-code-block.png" width={1434} height={368} />

You can find the corresponding Python file at `dagster/examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/concepts/asset/asset_dependenyy.py`. The code included in each snippet is the code in the file between the `# start_marker` and `# end_marker` comments.

<Image src="/images/community/py-code-block.png" width={736} height={496} />

To change the code snippet, update the `.py` file, then run the following from the `docs` directory:

```bash
make mdx-format
```

You can find more information about developing documentation in `docs/README.md`.

## Picking a Github Issue

We encourage you to start with an issue labeled with the tag [`good first issue`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22type%3A+good+first+issue%22) on the [Github issue board](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues), to get familiar with our codebase as a first-time contributor.

When you are ready for more of a challenge, you can tackle issues with the [most 👍 reactions](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). We factor engagement into prioritization of the issues. You can also explore other labels and pick any issue based on your interest.

## Submit Your Code

To submit your code, [fork the Dagster repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo), create a [new branch](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-to-projects/creating-a-branch-for-your-work) on your fork, and open [a Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) once your work is ready for review.
