# API Docs

These docs aim to cover the entire public surface of the core `dagster` APIs, as well as public APIs from all provided libraries.

Dagster follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/). We attempt to isolate breaking changes to the public APIs to minor versions (on a roughly 12-week cadence) and will announce deprecations in Slack and in the release notes to patch versions (on a roughly weekly cadence).

## Core

APIs from the core `dagster` package, divided roughly by topic:

- [Software-Defined Assets](/\_apidocs/assets). An asset is an object in persistent storage, such as a table, file, or persisted machine learning model. A software-defined asset is a Dagster object that couples an asset to the function and upstream assets that are used to produce its contents.

- [Jobs](/\_apidocs/jobs) APIs to define jobs that execute a set of ops with specific parameters.

- [Ops](/\_apidocs/ops) APIs to define or decorate functions as ops, declare their inputs and outputs, compose ops with each other, as well as the datatypes that op execution can return or yield.

- [Graphs](/\_apidocs/graphs) APIs to define a logical structure of ops.

- [Resources](/\_apidocs/resources) APIs to define resources which can provide specific implementations of certain functionality within a job.

- [Loggers](/\_apidocs/loggers) APIs to define where logs go.

- [Repositories](/\_apidocs/repositories) APIs to define collections of jobs and other definitions that tools such as the Dagster CLI or Dagit can load from.

- [Config](/\_apidocs/config) The types available to describe config schemas.

- [Types](/\_apidocs/types) The Dagster type system helps describe and verify at runtime the values that ops accept and produce.

- [Dagster CLI](/\_apidocs/cli) Browse repositories and execute jobs from the command line

- [Schedules & Sensors](/\_apidocs/schedules-sensors) APIs to define schedules and sensors that initiate job execution, as well as some built-in helpers for common cases.

- [Partitions](/\_apidocs/partitions) APIs to define partitions of the config space over which job runs can be backfilled.

- [Errors](/\_apidocs/errors) Errors thrown by the Dagster framework.

- [Execution](/\_apidocs/execution) APIs to execute and test jobs and individual ops, the execution context available to ops, job configuration, and the default executors available for executing jobs.

- [Hooks](/\_apidocs/hooks) APIs to define Dagster hooks, which can be triggered on specific Dagster events.

- [IO Managers](/\_apidocs/io-managers) APIs to define how inputs and outputs are handled and loaded.

- [Dynamic Mapping & Collect](/\_apidocs/dynamic) APIs that allow graph structures to be determined at run time.

- [Versioning & Memoization](/\_apidocs/memoization) (Experimental) Code versioning and memoization of previous outputs based upon that versioning.

- [Utilities](/\_apidocs/utilities) Miscellaneous helpers used by Dagster that may be useful to users.

- [Internals](/\_apidocs/internals) Core internal APIs that are important if you are interested in understanding how Dagster works with an eye towards extending it: logging, executors, system storage, the Dagster instance & plugin machinery, storage, schedulers.
