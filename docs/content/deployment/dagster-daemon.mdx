# Dagster daemon

Several Dagster features, like [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), and [run queueing](/guides/customizing-run-queue-priority), require a long-running `dagster-daemon` process to be included with your deployment.

---

## Starting the daemon

- [Running locally](#running-locally)
- [Deploying the daemon](#deploying-the-daemon)

### Running locally

<TabGroup>
  <TabItem name="Running the daemon and webserver">

The easiest way to run the Dagster daemon locally is to run the `dagster dev` command:

```shell
dagster dev
```

This command launches both the [Dagster webserver/UI](/concepts/dagster-ui) and the Dagster daemon, allowing you to start a full local deployment of Dagster from the command line. Refer to the [Running Dagster locally guide](/guides/running-dagster-locally) for more information about `dagster dev`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="Running only the daemon">

To run the Dagster daemon by itself:

```shell
dagster-daemon run
```

This command takes the same arguments as `dagster dev` for specifying where to find your code.

  </TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Deploying the daemon

For information on deploying the daemon to environments like Docker or Kubernetes, refer to the [deployment guides](/deployment/guides).

## Available daemons

The `dagster-daemon` process reads from your [Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance) file to determine which daemons should be included. Each of the included daemons then runs on a regular interval in its own threads.

The following daemons are currently available:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "20%",
        }}
      >

      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Enabled by</th>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If the daemon is configured to use a [workspace file](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files) to load code location(s), note that they will periodically reload the file. This means that the `dagster-daemon` process doesn't need to be restarted when workspace files are changed.

---

## Checking daemon status in the Dagster UI

To check the status of the `dagster-daemon` process in the UI:

1. In the top navigation, click **Deployment**.
2. Click the **Daemons** tab.

This tab displays information about all the daemons currently configured on your instance.

Each daemon periodically writes a heartbeat to your instance storage. If a daemon doesn't show a recent heartbeat, check the logs from your `dagster-daemon` process for errors.
