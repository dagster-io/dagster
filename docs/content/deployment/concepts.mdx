Learn about the concepts relevant to deploying Dagster. Refer to the [Core concepts section](/concepts) for info on developing with Dagster.

**Not sure where to start?** Check out the [Dagster architecture guide](/deployment/overview).

---

## Dagster instance

The `DagsterInstance` defines all of the configuration that Dagster needs for a single deployment - for example, where to store the history of past runs and their associated logs, where to stream the raw logs from op compute functions, and how to launch new runs.

[Learn more about setting up your Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance).

---

## Dagster daemon

The Dagster Daemon operates schedules, sensors, and run queuing.

[Learn more about the Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon).

---

## Run launchers

A run launcher is an interface to the computational resources used to execute Dagster runs. Dagster supports several types of run launchers and the ability to customize your own.

[Learn more about run launchers](/deployment/run-launcher).

---

## Executors

An executor is responsible for executing the steps within a job run. Once a run has launched and the process for the run (the run worker) has been allocated and started, the executor assumes responsibility for execution. Executors can range from single-process serial executors to managing per-step computational resources with a sophisticated control plane.

Dagster supports several types of executors and the ability to customize your own.

[Learn more about executors](/deployment/executors).

---

## Run coordinators

Run launchers allow you to control how Dagster manages the runs in your deployment. When a run is submitted, it's first sent to the run coordinator, which applies the limits or prioritization policies you define before submitting it to the run launcher.

[Learn more about run coordinators](/deployment/run-coordinator), including configuration, debugging, and how to limit run concurrency.

---

## Run monitoring

Run monitoring allows you to detect hanging runs and restart crashed run workers for certain run launchers.

[Learn more about run monitoring](/deployment/run-monitoring), including what run workers are supported.

---

## Run retries

Run retries allow you to define a maximum number of retries for failed jobs and handle crashed run workers.

[Learn more about enabling and configuring run retries](/deployment/run-retries).
