# Per-Op Limits in Kubernetes

## Overview

In addition to using the `k8s_job_executor` to run each op in its own Kubernetes job, Dagster also allows you to use Celery to limit the number of ops that can concurrently connect to a resource across all running Dagster jobs.

In this section, we demonstrate how to extend the [previous Helm deployment guide](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm) to support that use case, by deploying a more complex configuration of Dagster, which utilizes the <PyObject module="dagster_celery_k8s" object="CeleryK8sRunLauncher" /> and <PyObject module="dagster_celery_k8s" object="celery_k8s_job_executor" />.

## Prerequisites

In addition to the [previous prerequisites](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm#prerequisites), we expect familiarity with [Celery, a distributed task queue system](https://docs.celeryq.dev/).

The Helm chart can be configured to use this architecture by configuring the `runLauncher.type` field in your `values.yaml` file to be `CeleryK8sRunLauncher` instead of the default `K8sRunLauncher`. The resulting architecture is similar to the architecture described in the [Helm deployment guide](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm), with the following changes:

### Celery

Users can configure multiple Celery queues (for example, one celery queue for each resource the user would like to limit) and multiple Celery workers per queue via the `runLauncher.config.celeryK8sRunLauncher.workerQueues` section of `values.yaml`.

The Celery workers poll for new Celery tasks and execute each task in order of receipt or priority. The Celery task largely consists of launching an ephemeral Kubernetes step worker to execute that step.

### Daemon

The daemon now launches runs using the <PyObject module="dagster_celery_k8s" object="CeleryK8sRunLauncher" />.

### Run Worker

The run worker is still responsible for traversing the execution plan, but now uses the `celery_k8s_job_executor` to submit steps that are ready to be executed to the corresponding Celery queue (instead of executing the step itself).

All jobs being executed on an instance that uses the `CeleryK8sRunLauncher` must have the `celery_k8s_job_executor` set in the `executor_def` field.

### Step Worker

The step worker is responsible for executing a single step, writing the structured events to the database. The Celery worker polls for the step worker completion.

### Flower

[Flower](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an optional component that can be useful for monitoring Celery queues and workers.

## Walkthrough

We assume that you've followed the initial steps in the [previous walkthrough](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm#walkthrough) by building your docker image for your user code, pushing it to a registry, adding the Dagster Helm chart repository, and configuring your Helm User Deployment values. Note that any job that you wish to run in an instance using the `CeleryK8sRunLauncher` must be using the `celery_k8s_job_executor` as its executor. The [example user code repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/deploy_k8s/example_project) includes an example job that uses the `celery_k8s_job_executor`, called `celery_step_isolated_job`.

### Configure Persistent Object Storage

We need to configure persistent object storage so that data can be serialized and passed between steps. To run the Dagster User Code example, create a S3 bucket named "dagster-test".

To enable Dagster to connect to S3, provide `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables via the `env`, `envConfigMaps`, or `envSecrets` fields under `dagster-user-deployments` in `values.yaml` or (not recommended) by setting these variables directly in the User Code Deployment image.

### Install the Dagster Helm Chart with Celery

Install the Helm chart and create a release, with the run launcher configured to use the `CeleryK8sRunLauncher`. The helm chart checks for this run launcher type and includes Celery infrastructure in your cluster. Below, we've named our release `dagster`. We use `helm upgrade --install` to create the release if it does not exist; otherwise, the existing `dagster` release will be modified:

    helm upgrade --install dagster dagster/dagster -f /path/to/values.yaml \
      --set runLauncher.type=CeleryK8sRunLauncher \
      --set rabbitmq.enabled=true

Helm will launch several pods. You can check the status of the installation with `kubectl`. If everything worked correctly, you should see output like the following:

    $ kubectl get pods
    NAME                                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
    dagster-celery-workers-74886cfbfb-m9cbc                  1/1     Running     1          3m42s
    dagster-daemon-68c4b8d68d-vvpls                          1/1     Running     1          3m42s
    dagster-dagit-69974dd75b-5m8gg                           1/1     Running     0          3m42s
    dagster-k8s-example-user-code-1-88764b4f4-25mbd          1/1     Running     0          3m42s
    dagster-postgresql-0                                     1/1     Running     0          3m42s
    dagster-rabbitmq-0                                       1/1     Running     0          3m42s

### Run a job in your deployment

After Helm has successfully installed all the required kubernetes resources, start port forwarding to the Dagit pod via:

    export DAGIT_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default \
      -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=dagster,app.kubernetes.io/instance=dagster,component=dagit" \
      -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
    kubectl --namespace default port-forward $DAGIT_POD_NAME 8080:80

Visit <http://127.0.0.1:8080>, and navigate to the [launchpad](http://127.0.0.1:8080/workspace/example_repo@k8s-example-user-code-1/jobs/celery_step_isolated_job/launchpad). Notice how `resources.io_manager.config.s3_bucket` is set to `dagster-test`. You can replace this string with any other accessible S3 bucket. Then, click _Launch Run_.

You can introspect the jobs that were launched with `kubectl`:

    $ kubectl get jobs
    NAME                                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
    dagster-step-9f5c92d1216f636e0d33877560818840       1/1           5s         12s
    dagster-step-a1063317b9aac91f42ca9eacec551b6f       1/1           12s        34s
    dagster-run-fb6822e5-bf43-476f-9e6c-6f9896cf3fb8   1/1           37s        37s

`dagster-step-` entries correspond to step workers and `dagster-run-` entries correspond to run workers.

Within Dagit, you can watch the job as it executes.

### Configuring Celery Queues

Users can configure multiple Celery queues (for example, one queue for each resource to be limited) and multiple Celery workers per queue via the `runLauncher.config.celeryK8sRunLauncher.workerQueues` section of `values.yaml`.

To use the queues, `dagster-celery/queue` can be set on op tags.

By default, all ops will be sent to the default Celery queue named `dagster`.

```python
@op(
  tags = {
    'dagster-celery/queue': 'snowflake_queue',
  }
)
def my_op(context):
  context.log.info('running')
```

### Celery Priority

Users can set `dagster-celery/run_priority` on job tags to configure the baseline priority of all ops from that job. To set priority at the op level, users can set `dagster-celery/priority` on the op tags. When priorities are set on both a job and an op, the sum of both priorities will be used.

```python
@op(
  tags = {
    'dagster-celery/priority': 2,
  }
)
def my_op(context):
  context.log.info('running')

@job(
  tags = {
    'dagster-celery/run_priority': 3,
  }
)
def my_job():
  my_op()
```

### Configuring an External Message Broker

In a real deployment, users will likely want to set up an external message broker like Redis rather than RabbitMQ, which can be done by configuring `rabbitmq` and `redis` sections of `values.yaml`.

```yaml
rabbitmq:
  enabled: false

redis:
  enabled: true
  internal: false
  host: "redisHost"
  port: 6379
  brokerDbNumber: 0
  backendDbNumber: 0
```

## Conclusion

We deployed Dagster, configured with the <PyObject module="dagster_celery_k8s" object="CeleryK8sRunLauncher" />, onto a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
