# Deploying Dagster on Helm

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a container orchestration system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Dagster uses Kubernetes in combination with [Helm](https://helm.sh/), a package manager for Kubernetes applications. Using Helm, users specify the configuration of required Kubernetes resources to deploy Dagster through a [values file or command-line overrides](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). References to `values.yaml` in the following sections refer to [Dagster's `values.yaml`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/helm/dagster/values.yaml).

Dagster publishes a [fully-featured Helm chart](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/helm) to manage installing and running a production-grade Kubernetes deployment of Dagster. For each Dagster component in the chart, Dagster publishes a corresponding Docker image on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dagster).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need to:

- Have `kubectl` installed and configured with your desired Kubernetes cluster
- Understand [the basics of Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/)
- Have Helm 3 installed
- Have Docker installed

---

## Versioning

The [Dagster Helm chart](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dagster/dagster) is versioned with the same version numbers as the Dagster Python library. Ideally, the Helm chart and Dagster Python library should only be used together when their version numbers match.

In the following tutorial, we install the most recent version of the Dagster Helm chart. To use an older version of the chart, pass a `--version` flag to `helm upgrade`.

<TabItem name="Code location server">

A [code location server](/concepts/code-locations) runs a gRPC server and responds to the Dagster webserver's requests for information, such as:

- List all of the jobs in each code location, or
- What is the dependency structure of job X?

The user-provided image for the server must contain a [code location definition](/concepts/code-locations) and all of the packages needed to execute within the code location.

Users can have multiple code location servers. A common pattern is for each code location server to correspond to a different code location.

Code location servers can be updated independently from other Dagster components, including the webserver. As a result, updates to code locations can occur without causing downtime to any other code location or the webserver. After updating, if there is an error with any code location, an error is surfaced for that code location within the Dagster UI. All other code locations and the UI will still operate normally.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Dagster webserver">

The Dagster webserver communicates with user code deployments via gRPC to fetch information needed to populate the Dagster UI. The webserver doesn't load or execute user-written code, which allows the UI to remain available even when user code contains errors. The webserver frequently checks whether the user code deployment has been updated and if so, fetches the new information.

The webserver can be horizontally scaled by setting the `dagsterWebserver.replicaCount` field in `values.yaml`.

By default, the webserver launches runs via the <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="K8sRunLauncher" />, which creates a new Kubernetes job per run.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Daemon">

The [daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) periodically checks the runs table in PostgreSQL for runs that are ready to be launched. The daemon also submits runs from [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) and [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors).

The daemon launches runs via the <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="K8sRunLauncher" />, creating a run worker [job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) with the image specified in the user code deployment.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Run worker">

The run worker is responsible for executing launched Dagster runs. The run worker uses the same image as the user code deployment at the time the run was submitted. The run worker uses ephemeral compute and completes once the run is finished. Events that occur during the run are written to the database and then displayed in the UI.

Run worker jobs and pods are not automatically deleted so that users are able to inspect results. It's up to the user to periodically delete old jobs and pods.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Executor">

Each Dagster job specifies an [executor](/deployment/executors) that determines how the run worker will execute each step of the job. Different executors offer different levels of isolation and concurrency. Common choices are:

- <PyObject module="dagster" object="in_process_executor" /> - All steps run serially
  in a single process in a single pod
- <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" /> - Multiple processes
  run in a single pod
- <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="k8s_job_executor" /> - Each step runs in
  a separate Kubernetes job

Generally, increasing isolation incurs some additional overhead per step (e.g. starting up a new Kubernetes job vs starting a new process within a pod). The [executor](/deployment/executors) can be configured per-run in the `execution` block.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Database">

An external database (i.e. using a cloud provider's managed database service, like RDS) can be connected, or you can run PostgreSQL on Kubernetes. This database stores run event logs, other metadata, and powers much of the real-time and historical data visible in the UI. To maintain a referenceable history of events, we recommend connecting an external database for most use cases.

## Walkthrough

- [Step 1: Configure kubectl](#step-1-configure-kubectl)
- [Step 2: Build a Docker image for user code](#step-2-build-a-docker-image-for-user-code)
- [Step 3: Push Docker image to registry](#step-3-push-docker-image-to-registry)
- [Step 4: Set up Amazon S3](#step-4-set-up-amazon-s3)
- [Step 5: Add the Dagster Helm chart repository](#step-5-add-the-dagster-helm-chart-repository)
- [Step 6: Configure your user deployment](#step-6-configure-your-user-deployment)
- [Step 7: Install the Dagster Helm chart](#step-7-install-the-dagster-helm-chart)
- [Step 8: Run a job in your deployment](#step-8-run-a-job-in-your-deployment)

### Step 1: Configure kubectl

First, configure the `kubectl` CLI to point at a kubernetes cluster. You can use [`docker-desktop`](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) to set up a local k8s cluster to develop against or substitute with another k8s cluster as desired.

If you're using `docker-desktop` and you have a local cluster set up, configure the `kubectl` CLI to point to the local k8s cluster:

```shell
kubectl config set-context dagster --namespace default --cluster docker-desktop --user=docker-desktop
kubectl config use-context dagster
```

### Step 2: Build a Docker image for user code

<Note>
  Skip this step if using Dagster's example user code image (
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/dagster/user-code-example">
    <code>dagster/user-code-example</code>
  </a>
  ).
</Note>

In this step, you'll build a Docker image containing your Dagster definitions and any dependencies needed to execute the business logic in your code. For reference, here is an example [Dockerfile](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/blob/master/python_modules/automation/automation/docker/images/user-code-example/Dockerfile) and the corresponding [user code directory](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/deploy_k8s/example_project).

This example installs all of the Dagster-related dependencies in the Dockerfile and then copies the directory with the implementation of the Dagster repository into the root folder. We'll need to remember the path of this repository in a [later step](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm#step-6-configure-your-user-deployment) to set up the gRPC server as a deployment.

The example user code repository includes:

- An `example_job` job that runs all ops in a single pod
- A `pod_per_op_job` job that uses the <PyObject object="k8s_job_executor" module="dagster_k8s" /> to run each op in its own pod. **NOTE:** this job uses the <PyObject object="s3_pickle_io_manager" module="dagster_aws.s3" />, which requires [setting AWS credentials](/deployment/guides/aws#using-s3-for-io-management).
- A `pod_per_op_celery_job` that is only useful for [Celery deployments](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm-advanced).

For projects with many dependencies, we recommend publishing your Python project as a package and installing it in your Dockerfile.

### Step 3: Push Docker image to registry

<Note>
  Skip this step if using Dagster's example user code image (
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/dagster/user-code-example">
    <code>dagster/user-code-example</code>
  </a>
  ).
</Note>

Next, publish the image to a registry that is accessible from the Kubernetes cluster, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) ECR or DockerHub.

### Step 4: Set up Amazon S3

<Note>This step is optional.</Note>

Several of the jobs in [dagster/user-code-example](https://hub.docker.com/r/dagster/user-code-example) use an [S3 I/O Manager](/deployment/guides/aws#using-s3-for-io-management). To run these jobs, you'll need an available AWS S3 bucket and access to a pair of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values. This is because the I/O Manager uses [boto](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html).

This tutorial also has the option of using [`minio`](https://min.io/) to mock an S3 endpoint locally in k8s. **Note**: This option uses `host.docker.internal` to access a host from within Docker. This behavior has only been tested for MacOS and may need a different configuration for other platforms.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Using Amazon S3">

1. To use AWS S3, create a bucket in your AWS account. For this tutorial, we'll create a bucket called `test-bucket`.
2. Retrieve your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` credentials.
3. Run the following to create your k8s secrets:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic dagster-aws-access-key-id --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR ACCESS KEY ID>
kubectl create secret generic dagster-aws-secret-access-key --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET ACCESS KEY>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using local S3 - Minio">

1. Set up Minio locally:

   ```bash
   brew install minio/stable/minio # server
   brew install minio/stable/mc    # client
   mkdir $HOME/miniodata           # Prepare a directory for data
   minio server $HOME/miniodata    # start a server with default user/pass and no TLS
   mc --insecure alias set minio http://localhost:9000 minioadmin minioadmin
   # See it work
   mc ls minio
   date > date1.txt # create a sample file
   mc cp date1.txt minio://testbucket/date1.txt

   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="minioadmin"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin"
   # See the aws cli work
   aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 s3 mb s3://test-bucket
   aws --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 s3 cp date1.txt s3://test-bucket/
   ```

2. Run the following to create your k8s AWS secrets:

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic dagster-aws-access-key-id --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin
   kubectl create secret generic dagster-aws-secret-access-key --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin
   ```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Step 5: Add the Dagster Helm chart repository

The Dagster chart repository contains the versioned charts for all Dagster releases. Add the remote URL under the namespace `dagster` to install the Dagster charts.

```shell
helm repo add dagster https://dagster-io.github.io/helm
```

### Step 6: Configure your user deployment

- [Step 6.1: Configure the deployment](#step-61-configure-the-deployment)
- [Step 6.2: Run pod_per_op_job (optional)](#step-62-run-pod_per_op_job)

#### Step 6.1: Configure the deployment

In this step, you'll update the `dagster-user-deployments.deployments` section of the Dagster chart's `values.yaml` to include your deployment.

Here, we can specify the configuration of the Kubernetes deployment that creates the gRPC server for the webserver and daemon to access the user code. The gRPC server is created through the arguments passed to `dagsterApiGrpcArgs`, which expects a list of arguments for [`dagster api grpc`](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files#running-your-own-grpc-server).

To get access to the Dagster `values.yaml`, run:

```shell
helm show values dagster/dagster > values.yaml
```

The following snippet works for Dagster's example user code image. Since our Dockerfile contains the code location definition in a path, we specify arguments for the gRPC server to find this path under `dagsterApiGrpcArgs`.

**Note**: If you haven't set up an S3 endpoint, you can only run the job called `example_job`.

```yaml
dagster-user-deployments:
  enabled: true
  deployments:
    - name: "k8s-example-user-code-1"
      image:
        repository: "docker.io/dagster/user-code-example"
        tag: latest
        pullPolicy: Always
      dagsterApiGrpcArgs:
        - "--python-file"
        - "/example_project/example_repo/repo.py"
      port: 3030
```

`dagsterApiGrpcArgs` also supports loading code location definitions from a module name. Refer to the [code location documentation](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files#running-your-own-grpc-server) for a list of arguments.

You can also specify configuration like configmaps, secrets, volumes, resource limits, and labels for individual user code deployments:

```yaml file=/deploying/kubernetes/user_code_deployment_config.yaml
dagster-user-deployments:
  enabled: true
  deployments:
    - name: "k8s-example-user-code-1"
      image:
        repository: "docker.io/dagster/user-code-example"
        tag: latest
        pullPolicy: Always
      dagsterApiGrpcArgs:
        - "--python-file"
        - "/example_project/example_repo/repo.py"
      port: 3030
      envConfigMaps:
        - my-config-map
      envSecrets:
        - my-secret
      labels:
        foo_label: bar_value
      volumes:
        - name: my-volume
          configMap: my-config-map
      volumeMounts:
        - name: test-volume
          mountPath: /opt/dagster/test_folder
          subPath: test_file.yaml
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
      includeConfigInLaunchedRuns:
        enabled: true
```

By default, this configuration will also be included in the pods for any runs that are launched for the code location server. You can disable this behavior for a code location server by setting `includeConfigInLaunchedRuns.enabled` to `false` for that server.

#### Step 6.2 Run pod_per_op_job

You'll need a slightly different configuration to run the `pod_per_op_job`. This is because `pod_per_op_job` uses an `s3_pickle_io_manager`, so you'll need to provide the user code k8s pods with AWS S3 credentials.

Refer to [Step 4](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm#step-4-set-up-amazon-s3) for setup instructions. The below snippet works for both AWS S3 and a local S3 endpoint via `minio`:

```yaml
dagster-user-deployments:
  enabled: true
  deployments:
    - name: "k8s-example-user-code-1"
      image:
        repository: "docker.io/dagster/user-code-example"
        tag: latest
        pullPolicy: Always
      dagsterApiGrpcArgs:
        - "--python-file"
        - "/example_project/example_repo/repo.py"
      port: 3030
      envSecrets:
        - name: dagster-aws-access-key-id
        - name: dagster-aws-secret-access-key

runLauncher:
  type: K8sRunLauncher
  config:
    k8sRunLauncher:
      envSecrets:
        - name: dagster-aws-access-key-id
        - name: dagster-aws-secret-access-key
```

### Step 7: Install the Dagster Helm chart

Next, you'll install the Helm chart and create a release. Below, we've named our release `dagster`. We use `helm upgrade --install` to create the release if it doesn't exist; otherwise, the existing `dagster` release will be modified:

```shell
helm upgrade --install dagster dagster/dagster -f /path/to/values.yaml
```

Helm will launch several pods including PostgreSQL. You can check the status of the installation with `kubectl`. Note that it might take a few minutes for the pods to move to a `Running` state.

If everything worked correctly, you should see output like the following:

```shell
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dagster-webserver-645b7d59f8-6lwxh                    1/1     Running   0          11m
dagster-k8s-example-user-code-1-88764b4f4-ds7tn   1/1     Running   0          9m24s
dagster-postgresql-0                              1/1     Running   0          17m
```

### Step 8: Run a job in your deployment

After Helm has successfully installed all the required Kubernetes resources, start port forwarding to the webserver pod via:

```shell
DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default \
  -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=dagster,app.kubernetes.io/instance=dagster,component=webserver" \
  -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $DAGSTER_WEBSERVER_POD_NAME 8080:80
```

Next, try running a job. Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:8080>, then the [**Launchpad** tab](http://127.0.0.1:8080/workspace/example_repo@k8s-example-user-code-1/jobs/example_job/launchpad) for `example_job`, and click **Launch Run**.

You can introspect the jobs that were launched with `kubectl`:

```shell
$ kubectl get jobs
NAME                                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
dagster-run-5ee8a0b3-7ca5-44e6-97a6-8f4bd86ee630   1/1           4s         11s
```

Now, you can try a run with step isolation. Switch to the `pod_per_op_job` job, changing the default config to point to your S3 bucket if needed, and launch the run.

If you're using Minio, change your config to look like this:

```yaml
resources:
  io_manager:
    config:
      s3_bucket: "test-bucket"
  s3:
    config:
      # This use of host.docker.internal is unique to Mac
      endpoint_url: http://host.docker.internal:9000
      region_name: us-east-1
ops:
  multiply_the_word:
    config:
      factor: 0
    inputs:
      word: ""
```

Again, you can view the launched jobs:

```shell
kubectl get jobs
NAME                                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
dagster-run-5ee8a0b3-7ca5-44e6-97a6-8f4bd86ee630   1/1           4s         11s
dagster-run-733baf75-fab2-4366-9542-0172fa4ebc1f   1/1           4s         100s
```

That's it! You deployed Dagster, configured with the default <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="K8sRunLauncher" />, onto a Kubernetes cluster using Helm.
