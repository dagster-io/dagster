# Running Dagster as a Service

## Running the Dagster webserver

The core of any deployment of Dagster is [the Dagster webserver](/concepts/webserver/ui), a process that serves the Dagster UI and responds to GraphQL queries.

To run the webserver locally, first ensure that you are running a recent Python version. Typically, you'll want to run the webserver inside a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/). Then, you can install the webserver and any additional libraries you might need.

```shell
pip install dagster-webserver
```

To run the webserver, use a command like the following:

```shell
DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home dagster-webserver -h 0.0.0.0 -p 3000
```

In this configuration, the webserver will write execution logs to `$DAGSTER_HOME/logs` and listen on _0.0.0.0:3000_.

## Running the Dagster daemon

If you're using [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), or [backfills](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/backfills), or want to set limits on the number of runs that can be executed at once, you'll want to also run a [dagster-daemon service](/deployment/dagster-daemon) as part of your deployment. To run this service locally, run the following command:

```shell
pip install dagster

DAGSTER_HOME=/opt/dagster/dagster_home dagster-daemon run
```

The `dagster-daemon` process will periodically check your instance for any new runs that should be launched from your run queue or triggered by your running schedules or sensors. If you're running `dagster-daemon` in a different environment than `dagster-webserver`, it must also have access to your `dagster.yaml` file and `workspace.yaml` file and be able to access the components defined on your instance, and also be able to load the [repositories](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories) defined in your [workspace](/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files).

You can check the status of your `dagster-daemon` process in the UI by navigating to the Instance tab in the navigation bar on the left-hand side of the screen. A deployment can have multiple simultaneous instances of `dagster-webserver`, but should include only a single `dagster-daemon` process.
