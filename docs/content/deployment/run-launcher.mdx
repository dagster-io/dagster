## Overview

Runs instigated from the Dagit UI, the scheduler, or `dagster pipeline launch` are "launched" in Dagster. This is a distinct operation from "executing" a pipeline using the `execute_pipeline` python API or the CLI `execute` command. A 'launch' operation allocates computational resources (e.g. a process, a container, a kubernetes pod, etc) to carry out a run execution and then instigates the execution.

The core abstraction in the launch process is the run launcher, which is configured as part of the Dagster Instance. The run launcher is the interface to the computational resources that will be used to actually execute Dagster runs. It receives the ID of a created run and a representation of the pipeline that is about to undergo execution.

## Default Run Launcher

The simplest run launcher is the built-in run launcher, <PyObject module="dagster.core.launcher" object="DefaultRunLauncher" />. This run launcher spawns a new process on the same node as the pipeline's repository location. It also provides the ability to terminate launched runs.

## Other Run Launchers

Other run launchers include:

- <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="K8sRunLauncher" />, which allocates a
  Kubernetes Job per run.

  For more information, check out [Kubernetes Deployment Guides](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm).

- <PyObject module="dagster_aws" object="EcsRunLauncher" />, which launches an
  ECS task per run.

  For more information, check out [ECS Deployment Guides](/deployment/guides/ecs/).

- <PyObject module="dagster_docker" object="DockerRunLauncher" />, which
  launches runs in a Docker container.

  For more information, check out [Deploying Dagster to Docker Guide](/deployment/guides/docker) and [Docker deployment example](/deployment/guides/docker#example).

- <PyObject module="dagster_celery_k8s" object="CeleryK8sRunLauncher" />, which
  launches runs as single Kubernetes Jobs.

## Custom Run Launchers

A few examples of when a custom run launcher is needed:

- You want to allocate different computational resources for different pipelines or pipeline runs (e.g. GPUs for some, more cores or memory for others). These decisions should be made in the run launcher.
- You have custom infrastructure or custom APIs for allocating nodes for execution.

Colloquially we refer to the process or computational resource created by the run launcher as the run worker. The run launcher only determines the behavior of the run worker. Once execution starts within the run worker, it is the _executor_ -- an in-memory abstraction in the run worker process -- that takes over management of computational resources.
