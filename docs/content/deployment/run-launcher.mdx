# Run launchers

<Note>
  This guide is applicable to Dagster Open Source (OSS) deployments. For Dagster
  Cloud, refer to the <a href="/dagster-cloud">Dagster Cloud</a> documentation.
</Note>

Runs instigated from the Dagster UI, the scheduler, or the `dagster job launch` CLI command are launched in Dagster. This is a distinct operation from executing a job using the `execute_job` Python API or the CLI `execute` command. A launch operation allocates computational resources (e.g. a process, a container, a Kubernetes pod, etc) to carry out a run execution and then instigates the execution.

The core abstraction in the launch process is the run launcher, which is configured as part of the [Dagster instance](/deployment/dagster-instance) The run launcher is the interface to the computational resources that will be used to actually execute Dagster runs. It receives the ID of a created run and a representation of the pipeline that is about to undergo execution.

## Built-in run launchers

The simplest run launcher is the built-in run launcher, <PyObject object="DefaultRunLauncher" />. This run launcher spawns a new process per run on the same node as the job's code location.

Other run launchers include:

## Custom run launchers

A few examples of when a custom run launcher is needed:

- You have custom infrastructure or custom APIs for allocating nodes for execution.
- You have custom logic for launching runs on different clusters, platforms, etc.

We refer to the process or computational resource created by the run launcher as the [run worker](/deployment/overview#job-execution-flow). The run launcher only determines the behavior of the run worker. Once execution starts within the run worker, it is the executor - an in-memory abstraction in the run worker process - that takes over management of computational resources.
