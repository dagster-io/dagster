# Community

No ecosystem is more heterogeneous than data processing. We enthusiastically welcome community contributions to code and to docs, issue and bug reports on [Github](https://www.github.com/dagster-io/dagster/), and questions, feature requests, and discussion in our [Slack](https://dagster-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

If you're interested in hacking on Dagster, you'll want to consult our instructions on [setting up a local development environment](/community/contributing).

We are committed to making the Dagster project inclusive and welcoming. Working on this project should feel friendly, collegial, and relaxed for everyone. We take our [code of conduct](/community/code-of-conduct) seriously and encourage you to review it.

## Open Source

Dagster itself, defined as the code and intellectual property in this repository, will forever and always be free.

We plan to build a commercial product as a distinct and well-defined layer on top of Dagster. We believe that this structure will be the most sustainable for serving our users as the Dagster team and product grows.
