# Limiting concurrency in data pipelines

Concurrency is an essential concept in modern programming, particularly when working with data pipelines. While concurrency can improve the efficiency of your pipelines, too many processes executing at once can cause issues. Limiting concurrency in your data pipelines can help prevent performance problems and downtime.

By the end of this guide, you'll:

- Understand the basics of concurrency
- Learn about the options Dagster offers for limiting concurrency
- Learn how to configure concurrency in Dagster
- Understand how to troubleshoot run queueing issues

## Understanding the basics

Concurrency is the ability of a system to execute multiple processes in parallel. Before we go any further, let's go over the terminology in this guide:

### Understanding Dagster’s concurrency limit options

Dagster supports placing limits on the number of processes that can be in progress at a single time, at the run and op-level. Depending on your needs, one or both types may be suitable:

- **Run concurrency** controls the total number of runs in a deployment that can execute at the same time. Run concurrency applies to both op and asset-based jobs and all [code locations][code-location-concept] in a single deployment. Any runs beyond the limit will be queued and won’t use any compute.
- **Op/asset concurrency** controls the number of ops/assets that can execute in parallel **in a single run**.
- **Global op/asset concurrency <Experimental />** controls the number of ops/assets that can execute in parallel **across all runs**.

By limiting the number of parallel processes Dagster executes, you can ensure that resources are not overwhelmed and that each process has the resources it needs to run efficiently. This can lead to faster and more reliable pipeline execution, as well as easier monitoring and debugging of issues.

---

## Configuring run-level concurrency

Run concurrency can be configured by:

- Limiting the overall number of runs in a deployment
- Specifying limits using tags, which is useful for applying limits to specific jobs. For example, jobs that share a resource could all have the same tag.

These methods of limiting concurrency can be used individually or together. For each queued run, Dagster will check that launching the run will satisfy all conditions. For example, if launching a run would exceed the maximum number of concurrent runs, Dagster will queue the run until another run finishes.

**Note**: Run-level concurrency rules can't currently be used to prevent a run from being submitted to the queue; they only control limits for the number of runs in the queue that will be launched at once. If you want to prevent runs from ever being launched if another job is already running, check out [this Github discussion](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/discussions/8414) for an example.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Limiting overall runs">

### Limiting overall runs

How you limit the overall number of concurrent runs in a deployment depends on whether you're using Dagster+ or Dagster Open Source:

- **Dagster+**: Use the [Dagster+ UI or the `dagster-cloud` CLI][cloud-deployment-settings]
- **Dagster Open Source**: Use your instance's `dagster.yaml`

To enable this limit, use `run_queue.max_concurrent_runs`. For example, the following would limit the number of concurrent runs for the deployment to 15:

```yaml file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/dagster.yaml startafter=start_overall_example endbefore=end_overall_example
run_queue:
  max_concurrent_runs: 15
```

When defining a value for `max_concurrent_runs`, keep the following in mind:

- This setting defaults to `10`
- Disable the setting with a `-1` value, which means no limit will be enforced. **Note:** All other negative numbers are invalid, and disabling this setting isn't supported for Dagster+.
- A value of `0` prevents any runs from launching

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Limiting specific runs using tags">

### Limiting specific runs using tags

How you limit specific runs based on tags depends on whether you're using Dagster+ or Dagster Open Source:

- **Dagster+**: Use the [Dagster+ UI or the `dagster-cloud` CLI][cloud-deployment-settings]
- **Dagster Open Source**: Use your instance's `dagster.yaml`

To enable this limit, use `run_queue.tag_concurrency_limits`. This key accepts a list of tags and their corresponding concurrency limits.

```yaml file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/dagster.yaml startafter=start_tag_example endbefore=end_tag_example
run_queue:
  max_concurrent_runs: 15
  tag_concurrency_limits:
    - key: "database"
      value: "redshift" # applies when the `database` tag has a value of `redshift`
      limit: 4
    - key: "dagster/backfill" # applies when the `dagster/backfill` tag is present, regardless of value
      limit: 10
```

Let’s review what this configuration will do:

- For runs with a `database` tag with a value of `redshift`, a maximum of four runs can execute concurrently
- For runs with a `dagster/backfill` tag, a maximum of 10 runs can execute concurrently. Note that this implementation applies to **any** value of the `dagster/backfill` tag, whereas the `database: redshift` example only applies the limit when there’s a specific tag value.

#### Limiting runs by unique tag value

To apply separate limits to each unique value of a tag, set a limit for each unique value using `applyLimitPerUniqueValue`:

```yaml file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/per-unique-value-dagster.yaml
run_queue:
  tag_concurrency_limits:
    - key: "use-case"
      value:
        applyLimitPerUniqueValue: true
      limit: 3
```

With this configuration, each unique value of the `use-case` tag will be limited to three concurrent runs. For example, `team: marketing` and `team: sales` will both be limited to three concurrent runs each.

## Configuring op/asset-level concurrency

<Note>
  <strong>Looking for global op/asset concurrency?</strong> Check out Dagster's
  experimental support for{" "}
  <a href="/guides/limiting-concurrency-in-data-pipelines#limiting-opasset-concurrency-across-runs">
    global op/asset concurrency limits
  </a>
  . For more fine-grained control, you can also check out our <a href="/deployment/guides/celery">
    integration with Celery
  </a>.
</Note>

Utilizing op/asset-level concurrency provides fine-grained control for the maximum number of ops/assets that can be executed at once within a single run, ensuring that shared resources aren't overwhelmed.

Op and asset-level concurrency is enabled by configuring a [job executor](/deployment/executors). Using the executor, you can:

- Limit the number of ops/assets that can execute in a single run at once
- Specify limits using tags

### Limiting overall concurrency in a job

To limit concurrency for ops and assets in jobs, use `max_concurrent` in the job’s config, either in Python or using the Launchpad in the Dagster UI.

**Note**: The examples in this section use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />, which uses the `multiprocess` key. This key will change depending on the type of executor you're using. Refer to the [Job executor documentation](/deployment/executors#example-executors) for more info.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="In Python">

While `max_concurrent` is used to limit concurrency in both asset and op-based jobs, how jobs are defined differs between assets and ops. Click the tabs below for examples.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Asset-based jobs">

#### Asset-based jobs

Asset jobs are defined using <PyObject object="define_asset_job" />. In this example, using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />, the job will execute up to three assets at once:

```python
assets_job = define_asset_job(
    name="assets_job",
    config={
        "execution": {
            "config": {
                "multiprocess": {
                    "max_concurrent": 3,      # limits concurrent assets to 3
                },
            }
        }
    }
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Op-based jobs">

#### Op-based jobs

Op-based jobs are defined using the <PyObject object="job" decorator /> decorator. In this example, using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />, the job will execute up to four ops at once:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/job_execution.py startafter=start_tag_concurrency endbefore=end_tag_concurrency
@job(
    config={
        "execution": {
            "config": {
                "multiprocess": {
                    "max_concurrent": 4,
                    "tag_concurrency_limits": [
                        {
                            "key": "database",
                            "value": "redshift",
                            "limit": 2,
                        }
                    ],
                },

    }
)
def tag_concurrency_job(): ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="In the Dagster UI">

In the Dagster UI, navigate to the details page for a job, then the **Launchpad** tab. In this example, using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />, the job will execute up to three ops/assets at once:

### Limiting concurrency using tags

Limits can be specified for all ops/assets with a specific tag key or key-value pair. If any limit would be exceeded by launching an op/asset, then the op/asset will be queued.

To specify limits on the number of ops/assets with a specific tag, use `tag_concurrency_limits` in the job’s config, either in Python or using the Launchpad in the Dagster UI.

**Note**: The examples in this section use the <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />, which uses the `multiprocess` key. This key will change depending on the type of executor you're using. Refer to the [Job executor documentation](/deployment/executors#example-executors) for more info.

#### Asset-based jobs

Unlike op-based jobs, asset jobs use the `op_tags` field on each asset when checking them for tag concurrency limits. In this example, using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="multiprocess_executor" />, the job will execute up to three assets at once with the `database` tag equal to `snowflake`:

```python
# example asset with tags, specified using op_tags
@asset(op_tags={"database": "snowflake"})
def asset1():
    ...

assets_job = define_asset_job(

### Limiting op/asset concurrency across runs

#### For specific ops/assets

Limits can be specified on the Dagster instance using the special op tag `dagster/concurrency_key`. If this instance limit would be exceeded by launching an op/asset, then the op/asset will be queued.

For example, to globally limit the number of running ops touching Redshift to two, the op/asset must be first tagged with the global concurrency key:

```python file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/concurrency_limits.py startafter=start_global_concurrency endbefore=end_global_concurrency
@op(tags={"dagster/concurrency_key": "redshift"})
def my_redshift_op(): ...


@asset(op_tags={"dagster/concurrency_key": "redshift"})
def my_redshift_table(): ...
```

To specify limits on the number of ops/assets tagged with a particular concurrency key, you can either use the `dagster` CLI command or the Dagster UI:

- To specify a global concurrency limit using the CLI, use:

  ```shell
  dagster instance concurrency set <concurrency_key> <limit>
  ```

- To specify a global concurrency limit using the Dagster UI, navigate to the **Concurrency limits** tab on the Deployment page.

The concurrency key should match the name that the op/asset is tagged with. For example, if the op/asset is tagged with `dagster/concurrency_key: redshift`, then the concurrency key should be `redshift`.

#### For all ops/assets

A default concurrency limit can be configured for the instance, for any concurrency keys that do not have an explicit limit set:

- **Dagster+**: Edit the `concurrency` config in deployment settings via the [Dagster+ UI or the `dagster-cloud` CLI][cloud-deployment-settings]
- **Dagster Open Source**: Edit the `concurrency` config in your instance's `dagster.yaml`

To enable this default value, use `concurrency.default_op_concurrency_limit`. For example, the following would set the default concurrency value for the deployment to 1:

```yaml file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/dagster.yaml startafter=start_default_value endbefore=end_default_value
concurrency:
  default_op_concurrency_limit: 1
```

#### Setting priority for ops/assets

By default, slots will be allocated to op / asset execution on a first-in-first-out basis. However, steps from high priority runs will take precedence over steps from low priority runs, as determined by the priority tag on the individual run.

```python startafter=start_marker_priority endbefore=end_marker_priority file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/concurrency_limits.py
@job(tags={"dagster/priority": "3"})
def important_job(): ...


@schedule(
    cron_schedule="* * * * *",
    job_name="important_job",
    execution_timezone="US/Central",
    tags={"dagster/priority": "-1"},
)
def less_important_schedule(_): ...
```

Priority can also be assigned based on the priority tag of the op/asset definition.

```python file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/concurrency_limits.py startafter=start_global_concurrency_priority endbefore=end_global_concurrency_priority
@op(tags={"dagster/concurrency_key": "foo", "dagster/priority": "3"})
def my_op(): ...


@asset(op_tags={"dagster/concurrency_key": "foo", "dagster/priority": "3"})
def my_asset(): ...
```

When the priority tag is set on both the run and the asset/op definition, the step priority will be the sum of the two values.

#### Freeing concurrency slots

With a global concurrency limit set, it is useful to configure your instance to automatically free slots for canceled/failed runs. Certain execution errors can cause steps to exit without freeing an occupied concurrency slot.

To automatically recover from this state, you can configure your instance's run monitoring to automatically free concurrency slots for runs that have reached some terminal state (e.g. failed or canceled runs).

In `dagster.yaml`, you can configure the interval between a run end and the slot clean up like so:

```yaml file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/dagster.yaml startafter=start_free_slots endbefore=end_free_slots
run_monitoring:
  enabled: true
  free_slots_after_run_end_seconds: 300 # free any hanging concurrency slots after 5 minutes from the end of a run
```

#### Throttling concurrency-limited runs

If a global concurrency limit is set, some runs may be active without an executing op due to concurrency restraints. When this occurs, runs can unnecessarily utilize resources or make it difficult to see whether other runs are progressing.

You can throttle runs and block their step progression to mitigate this issue. To do this, configure the run queue to keep these runs in a `QUEUED` state until a slot becomes free for one of its steps:

```yaml file=/deploying/concurrency_limits/dagster.yaml startafter=start_throttle_op_concurrency_limited_runs endbefore=end_throttle_op_concurrency_limited_runs
run_queue:
  block_op_concurrency_limited_runs:
    enabled: true
    op_concurrency_slot_buffer: 1 # buffer of 1 means 1 run might be started even though there are no slots available
```

---

## Troubleshooting

When limiting concurrency, you might run into some issues until you get the configuration right.

### Runs going to STARTED status and skipping QUEUED

<Note>This only applies to Dagster Open Source.</Note>

The `run_queue` key may not be set in your instance's settings. In the Dagster UI, navigate to **Deployment > Configuration** and verify that the `run_queue` key is set.

### Runs remaining in QUEUED status

The possible causes for runs remaining in `QUEUED` status depend on whether you're using Dagster+ or Dagster Open Source.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Dagster+">

If runs aren't being dequeued in Dagster+, the root causes could be:

- **If using a [Hybrid deployment](/dagster-plus/deployment/hybrid)**, the agent serving the deployment may be down. In this situation, runs will be paused.
- **Dagster+ is experiencing downtime**. Check the [status page](http://dagstercloud.statuspage.io/) for the latest on potential outages.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Dagster Open Source">

If runs aren’t being dequeued in Dagster Open Source, the root cause is likely an issue with the Dagster daemon or the run queue configuration.

- **Troubleshoot the Dagster daemon**:

  1. **Verify the Dagster daemon is set up and running**. In the Dagster UI, navigate to **Deployment > Daemons** and verify that the daemon is running. The **Run queue** should also be running. If you used [`dagster dev`](/guides/running-dagster-locally) to start the Dagster UI, the daemon should have been started for you.

     If the daemon isn’t running, proceed to step 2.

  2. **Verify the Dagster daemon can access the same storage as the Dagster webserver process**. Both the webserver process and the Dagster daemon should access the same storage, meaning they should use the same `dagster.yaml`. Locally, this means both processes should have the same set `DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable. If you used [`dagster dev`](/guides/running-dagster-locally) to start the Dagster UI, both processes should be using the same storage.

     Refer to the [Dagster Instance docs](/deployment/dagster-instance) for more information.

- **Troubleshoot the run queue configuration**: If the daemon is running, runs may intentionally be left in the queue due to concurrency rules. To investigate, you can:

  - **Check the output logged from the daemon process**, as this will include skipped runs.
  - **Check the `max_concurrent_runs` setting in your instance’s `dagster.yaml`.** If set to `0`, this may block the queue. You can check this setting in the Dagster UI by navigating to **Deployment > Configuration** and locating the `run_queue.max_concurrent_runs` setting. Refer to the [Limiting overall runs section](#limiting-overall-runs) for more info.
  - **Check the state of your run queue**. In some cases, the queue may be blocked by some number of in-progress runs. To view the status of your run queue, click **Runs** in the top navigation of the Dagster UI and then open the **Queued** and **In Progress** tabs.

    If there are queued or in-progress runs blocking the queue, you can terminate them to allow other runs to proceed.
