### Hands-on Guides to Deploying Dagster

This section provides a series of hands-on guides to walk you through Dagster deployment and execution. The deploying guides focus on the basics of setting up Dagster, including running the Dagit web server. The executing guides focus on submitting to different compute substrates for more advanced job execution. These can be mixed and matched- for example you could have the Dagit server deployed on AWS EC2, and execute your jobs on a Dask cluster.
