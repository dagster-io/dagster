# A Single-Op Job

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/" />

## Ops and Jobs

Dagster's core abstractions are **[ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops)** and **[jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)**.

**[Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops)** are individual units of computation that we wire together to form **[jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs)**.

In this section, we'll cover how to define a simple job with a single op, and then execute it.

## The Cereal Dataset

Our job will operate on a simple but scary CSV dataset, cereal.csv, which contains nutritional facts about 80 breakfast cereals.

## Hello, Op!

Let's write our first Dagster op and save it as `hello_cereal.py`.

A op is a unit of computation in a job. Typically, you'll define ops by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="op" displayText="@op" /> decorator.

Our first op does three things: downloads a CSV of cereal data, reads it into a list of dictionaries which each represent a row in the CSV, and logs the number of rows it finds.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_solid_marker endbefore=end_solid_marker
import requests
import csv
from dagster import job, op, get_dagster_logger


@op
def hello_cereal():
    response = requests.get("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/cereal.csv")
    lines = response.text.split("\n")
    cereals = [row for row in csv.DictReader(lines)]
    get_dagster_logger().info(f"Found {len(cereals)} cereals")
```

In this simple case, our op takes no arguments, and also returns no outputs. Don't worry, we'll soon encounter ops that are much more dynamic.

## Hello, Job!

To execute our op, we'll embed it in an equally simple job. A job is a set of ops arranged into a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computation. You'll typically define jobs by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject
module="dagster" object="job" displayText="@job" /> decorator.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_pipeline_marker endbefore=end_pipeline_marker
@job
def hello_cereal_job():
    hello_cereal()
```

Here you'll see that we call `hello_cereal()`. This call doesn't actually execute the op. Within the bodies of functions decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="job"
displayText="@job" />, we use function calls to indicate the dependency structure of the op making up the job. Here, we indicate that the execution of `hello_cereal` doesn't depend on any other ops by calling it with no arguments.

## Executing Our First Job

Assuming you’ve saved this job as `hello_cereal.py`, you can execute it via any of three different mechanisms:

### Dagit

To visualize your job (which only has one op) in Dagit, just run the following. Make sure you're in the directory in which you've saved the job file:

```bash
dagit -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see output like

```bash
Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your web browser and view your job. It isn't very interesting yet, because it only has one op.

<img
alt="hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_one.png"
/>

Click on the "Launchpad" tab and you'll see the view below.

<img
alt="hello_cereal_figure_two.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_two.png"
/>

The large upper left pane is empty here, but, in jobs with parameters, this is where you'll be able to edit job configuration on the fly.

Click the "Launch Run" button on the bottom right to execute this job directly from Dagit. A new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1—or, just navigate to the "Runs" tab to see this, and every run of your job.

<img
alt="hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
src="/images/tutorial/hello_cereal_figure_three.png"
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to your job run.

### Dagster CLI

From the directory in which you've saved the job file, just run:

```bash
dagster job execute -f hello_cereal.py
```

You'll see the full stream of events emitted by Dagster appear in the console, including our call to the logging machinery, which will look like:

```bash
2021-02-05 08:50:25 - dagster - INFO - system - ce5d4576-2569-44ff-a14a-51010eea5329 - hello_cereal - Found 77 cereals
```

Success!

### Python API

If you'd rather execute your jobs as a script, you can do that without using the Dagster CLI at all. Just add a few lines to `hello_cereal.py`

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_solid_pipeline/hello_cereal.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = hello_cereal_job.execute_in_process()
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python hello_cereal.py
```
