# Linking to assets' code with code references

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong> and is under active
  development. This guide will be updated as we roll out new features.
</Note>

Attaching code reference metadata to your Dagster asset definitions allows you to easily view those assets' source code from the Dagster UI:

- **In local development**, navigate directly to the code backing an asset in your editor
- **In your production environment**, link to source code in your source control repository to see the full change history for an asset

In this guide, we'll show you how to automatically and manually attach code references to your Dagster assets.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A set of Dagster asset definitions that you want to link to code
- Dagster version `1.7.6` or newer

---

## Automatically attaching code references to asset definitions

To automatically attach code references to the asset's function definition, you can use the `dagster._core.definitions.metadata.with_source_code_references` utility. Any asset definitions passed to the utility will have their source file attached as metadata.

```python file=/guides/dagster/code_references/with_source_code_references.py
from dagster import Definitions, asset
from dagster._core.definitions.metadata import with_source_code_references


@asset
def my_asset(): ...


@asset
def another_asset(): ...


defs = Definitions(assets=with_source_code_references([my_asset, another_asset]))
```

A link to the asset's source in `with_source_code_references.py` will then be visible in the **Asset Catalog** view in the Dagster UI:

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Asset catalog view showing link to with_source_code_references.py"
    src="/images/guides/code-references/with_source_code_references.png"
    width={1590}
    height={326}
  />
</center>

## Manually attaching code references to asset definitions

In some cases, you may want to manually attach code references to your asset definitions. Some assets may have a more complex source structure, such as an asset whose definition is spread across multiple Python source files or an asset which is partially defined with a `.sql` model file.

To manually attach code references to an asset definition, use `CodeReferencesMetadataValue`. You can then choose to augment these manual references with `with_source_code_references`:

```python file=/guides/dagster/code_references/manual_references.py
import os

from dagster import Definitions, asset
from dagster._core.definitions.metadata import (
    CodeReferencesMetadataValue,
    LocalFileCodeReference,
    with_source_code_references,
)


@asset(
    metadata={
        "dagster/code_references": CodeReferencesMetadataValue(
            code_references=[
                LocalFileCodeReference(
                    file_path=os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "source.yaml"),
                    # Label and line number are optional
                    line_number=1,
                    label="Model YAML",
                )
            ]
        )
    }
)
def my_asset_modeled_in_yaml(): ...


defs = Definitions(assets=with_source_code_references([my_asset_modeled_in_yaml]))
```

Each of the code references to `manual_references.py` will be visible in the **Asset details** page in the Dagster UI:

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Asset details view showing link to multiple files"
    src="/images/guides/code-references/manual_references.png"
    width={1592}
    height={389}
  />
</center>
