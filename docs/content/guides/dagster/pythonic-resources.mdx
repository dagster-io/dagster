# Pythonic resources

<Note>
  This feature is considered <strong>experimental</strong>.
</Note>

This guide acts as an introduction to Dagster resources utilizing the new Pythonic resources API layer, which makes defining and using Dagster [resources](/concepts/resources) easier.

Resources are objects that are shared across the implementations of multiple [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) and that can be plugged in after defining those ops and assets.

Resources typically model external components that assets and ops interact with. For example, a resource might be a connection to a data warehouse like Snowflake or a service like Slack.

So, why use resources?

- **Plug in different implementations in different environments** - If you have a heavy external dependency that you want to use in production, but avoid using in testing, you can accomplish this by providing different resources in each environment. Check out [Separating Business Logic from Environments](/concepts/testing#separating-business-logic-from-environments) for more info about this capability.
- **Surface configuration in the UI** - Resources and their configuration are surfaced in the Dagster UI, making it easy to see where your resources are used and how they are configured.
- **Share configuration across multiple ops or assets** - Resources are configurable and shared, so you can supply configuration in one place instead of configuring the ops and assets individually.
- **Share implementations across multiple ops or assets** - When multiple ops access the same external services, resources provide a standard way to structure your code to share the implementations.

## Using Pythonic resources

### Getting started using resources

Typically, resources are defined by subclassing <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/>. Attributes on the class are used to define the resource's [configuration schema](/concepts/configuration/config-schema). The configuration system has a few advantages over plain Python parameter passing; configured values are displayed in the Dagster UI and can be set dynamically using environment variables.

Assets and ops specify resource dependencies by annotating the resource as a parameter to the asset or op function.

To provide resource values to your assets and ops, attach them to your <PyObject object="Definitions" /> call. These resources are automatically passed to the function at runtime.

<TabGroup persistentKey="assetsorops">
<TabItem name="Using software-defined-assets">

#### Using software-defined assets

Here, we define a subclass of <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> representing a connection to an external service. We can configure the resource by constructing it in the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> call.

We can define methods on the resource class which depend on config values. These methods can be used by assets and ops.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_configurable_defs endbefore=end_new_resources_configurable_defs
from dagster import asset, Definitions
from dagster._config.structured_config import ConfigurableResource


class MyConnectionResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str

    def request(self, endpoint: str) -> Response:
        return requests.get(
            f"https://my-api.com/{endpoint}",
            auth=(self.username, self.password),
        )


@asset
def data_from_service(my_conn: MyConnectionResource) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return my_conn.request("/fetch_data").json()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[data_from_service],
    resources={
        "my_conn": MyConnectionResource(username="my_user", password="my_password"),
    },
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using ops and jobs">

#### Using ops

Here, we define a subclass of <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> representing a connection to an external service. We can configure the resource by constructing it in the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> call.

We can define methods on the resource class which depend on config values. These methods can be used by assets and ops.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_configurable_defs_ops endbefore=end_new_resources_configurable_defs_ops
from dagster import Definitions, job, op
from dagster._config.structured_config import ConfigurableResource


class MyConnectionResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str

    def request(self, endpoint: str) -> Response:
        return requests.get(
            f"https://my-api.com/{endpoint}",
            auth=(self.username, self.password),
        )


@op
def update_service(my_conn: MyConnectionResource):
    my_conn.request("/update")


@job
def update_service_job():
    update_service()


defs = Definitions(
    jobs=[update_service_job],
    resources={
        "my_conn": MyConnectionResource(username="my_user", password="my_password"),
    },
)
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Using environment variables with resources

Resources can be configured using environment variables, which is useful for secrets or other environment-specific configuration. If you're using Dagster Cloud, environment variables can be [configured directly in the UI](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets).

To use environment variables, pass an <PyObject object="EnvVar" /> when constructing your resource.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_env_vars endbefore=end_new_resources_env_vars
from dagster._config.field_utils import EnvVar
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster._config.structured_config import ConfigurableResource


class CredentialsResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str


defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={
        "credentials": CredentialsResource(
            username=EnvVar("MY_USERNAME"),
            password=EnvVar("MY_PASSWORD"),
        )
    },
)
```

---

### Configuring resources at runtime

In some cases, you may want to specify configuration for a resource at runtime, in the launchpad or in a <PyObject object="RunRequest" /> for a [schedule](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or [sensor](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors). For example, you may want a sensor-triggered run to specify a different target table in a database resource for each run.

You can use the `configure_at_launch()` method to defer the construction of a configurable resource until runtime.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_runtime endbefore=end_new_resource_runtime
class DatabaseResource(ConfigurableResource):
    table: str

    def read(self):
        ...


@asset
def data_from_database(db_conn: DatabaseResource):
    return db_conn.read()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={"db_conn": DatabaseResource.configure_at_launch()},
)
```

---

### Resources which depend on other resources

In some situations, you may want to define a resource which depends on other resources. This is useful for common configuration. For example, separate resources for a database and for a filestore may both depend on credentials for a particular cloud provider. Defining these credentials as a separate, nested resource allows you to specify configuration in a single place.

In this case, you can list that nested resource as an attribute of your resource class.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_nesting endbefore=end_new_resources_nesting
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster._config.structured_config import ConfigurableResource


class CredentialsResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str


class FileStoreBucket(ConfigurableResource):
    credentials: CredentialsResource
    region: str

    def write(self, data: str):
        get_filestore_client(
            username=self.credentials.username,
            password=self.credentials.password,
            region=self.region,
        ).write(data)


credentials = CredentialsResource(username="my_user", password="my_password")
defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={
        "bucket": FileStoreBucket(
            credentials=credentials,
            region="us-east-1",
        ),
    },
)
```

If we instead would like the configuration for our credentials to be provided at runtime, we can use the `configure_at_launch()` method to defer the construction of the `CredentialsResource` until runtime.

Because `credentials` requires runtime configuration through the launchpad, it must also be passed to the `Definitions` object, so that configuration can be provided at runtime. Nested resources only need to be passed to the `Definitions` object if they require runtime configuration.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_dep_job_runtime endbefore=end_new_resource_dep_job_runtime
credentials = CredentialsResource.configure_at_launch()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={
        "credentials": credentials,
        "bucket": FileStoreBucket(
            credentials=credentials,
            region="us-east-1",
        ),
    },
)
```

### Testing configurable resources

You can test the initialization of a <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> by constructing it manually. In most cases, you can construct your resource directly:

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_testing endbefore=end_new_resource_testing
from dagster._config.structured_config import ConfigurableResource, ConfigurableResourceAdapter

V = TypeVar("V")


class ResourceDependency(Generic[V]):
    def __get__(self, obj: "Resource", __owner: Any) -> V:
        return getattr(obj, self._name)


class MyResource(ConfigurableResource):
    value: str

    def get_value(self) -> str:
        return self.value


def test_my_resource():
    assert MyResource(value="foo").get_value() == "foo"
```

If your resource requires other resources, then you can pass them as constructor arguments.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_testing_with_context endbefore=end_new_resource_testing_with_context
from dagster._config.structured_config import ConfigurableResource


class StringHolderResource(ConfigurableResource):
    value: str


class MyResourceRequiresAnother(ConfigurableResource):
    foo: StringHolderResource
    bar: str


def test_my_resource_with_context():
    string_holder = StringHolderResource(value="foo")
    resource = MyResourceRequiresAnother(foo=string_holder, bar="bar")
    assert resource.foo.value == "foo"
    assert resource.bar == "bar"
```

---

## Defining Pythonic IO managers

Pythonic [IO managers](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) are defined as subclasses of <PyObject object="ConfigurableIOManager"/>, and similarly to Pythonic resources specify any configuration fields as attributes. Each subclass must implement a `handle_output` and `load_input` method, which are called by the Dagster runtime to handle the storing and loading of data.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_io_manager endbefore=end_new_io_manager
class MyIOManager(ConfigurableIOManager):
    root_path: str

    def _get_path(self, asset_key: AssetKey) -> str:
        return self.root_path + "/".join(asset_key.path)

    def handle_output(self, context: OutputContext, obj):
        write_csv(self._get_path(context.asset_key), obj)

    def load_input(self, context: InputContext):
        return read_csv(self._get_path(context.asset_key))

defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={
        "io_manager": MyIOManager(root_path="/tmp/")
    },
)
```

## Advanced resource patterns

The following sections describe more advanced patterns for using Pythonic resources.

### Adapting function-style resources

In codebases which utilize [function-style](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/resources#resources) resources with the <PyObject object="@resource"/> decorator, you can use the <PyObject object="ConfigurableResourceAdapter"/> class to adapt these resources to the new Pythonic resource pattern.

The adapter subclass should list all config fields as attributes, and should implement a `wrapped_resource` property which returns the underlying resource definition to adapt.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_resource_adapter endbefore=end_resource_adapter
# Old code, cannot be changed for back-compat purposes
class Writer:
    def __init__(self, prefix: str):
        self._prefix = prefix

    def output(self, text: str) -> None:
        print(self._prefix + text)


@resource(config_schema={"prefix": str})
def writer_resource(context):
    prefix = context.resource_config["prefix"]
    return Writer(prefix)


# New adapter layer
class WriterResource(ConfigurableResourceAdapter):
    prefix: str

    @property
    def wrapped_resource(self) -> ResourceDefinition:
        return writer_resource


@asset
def my_asset(writer: Writer):
    writer.output("hello, world!")


defs = Definitions(assets=[my_asset], resources={"writer": WriterResource(prefix="greeting: ")})
```

### Using bare Python objects as resources

In some cases, you may want to use a bare Python object as a resource which is not a subclass of <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/>.

For example, you may want to directly pass a third-party API client into your assets or ops. This follows a similar pattern to using a <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> subclass, however assets and ops which use these resources must [annotate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) them with <PyObject object="Resource"/>.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_raw_github_resource endbefore=end_raw_github_resource
@asset
def public_github_repos(github: Resource[GitHub]):
    return github.organization("dagster-io").repositories()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[public_github_repos],
    resources={"github": GitHub()},
)
```

If you would like a Pythonic resource to depend on a bare Python object, you can use the <PyObject object="ResourceDependency"/> annotation to annotate the attribute in question. This indicates to Dagster that the attribute should be treated as a resource dependency.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_raw_github_resource_dep endbefore=end_raw_github_resource_dep
class DBResource(ConfigurableResource):
    engine: ResourceDependency[Engine]

    def query(self, query: str):
        with self.engine.connect() as conn:
            return conn.execute(query)


engine = create_engine(...)
defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={"db": DBResource(engine=engine)},
)
```

## Implementation details

### Resource input resolution

Resources defined by subclassing <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> can take various unresolved inputs, including `EnvVar`s instead of string values or unconfigured resources returned by `configure_at_launch()` in place of configured resources.

Between construction time and runtime, the <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> class resolves all of its attributes to their final values, meaning that when an attribute of a resource is accessed in the body of an asset or op, it will always be a fully resolved value.

In the following example, the `FileStoreBucket` constructor will accept the still-unconfigured `unconfigured_credentials_resource`, which will be resolved once the resource is configured at runtime.

```python file=/guides/dagster/pythonic_resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_impl_details_resolve endbefore=end_impl_details_resolve
class CredentialsResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str


class FileStoreBucket(ConfigurableResource):
    credentials: CredentialsResource
    region: str

    def write(self, data: str):
        # In this context, `self.credentials` is ensured to
        # be a CredentialsResource

        get_filestore_client(
            username=self.credentials.username,
            password=self.credentials.password,
            region=self.region,
        ).write(data)


# unconfigured_credentials_resource is typed as PartialResource[CredentialsResource]
unconfigured_credentials_resource = CredentialsResource.configure_at_launch()

# FileStoreBucket constructor accepts either a CredentialsResource or a
# PartialResource[CredentialsResource] for the `credentials` argument
bucket = FileStoreBucket(
    credentials=unconfigured_credentials_resource,
    region="us-east-1",
)
```
