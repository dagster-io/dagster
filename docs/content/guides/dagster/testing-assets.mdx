# Testing assets

Creating testable and verifiable data pipelines is one of the focuses of Dagster. We believe ensuring data quality is critical for managing the complexity of data systems. Here, we'll cover how to write unit tests for individual assets, as well as for graphs of assets together.

**Note**: This guide describes approaches to unit testing assets, but **asset checks** can be used to test assets at runtime! Using asset checks, you can verify the quality of data produced by your pipelines, communicate what the data is expected to do, and more. Refer to the [Asset checks](/concepts/assets/asset-checks) documentation for more information and examples.

## Prerequisites

This guide builds off of the project written in the [tutorial](/tutorial). If you haven't already, you should complete the tutorial before continuing. Other guides may also build off the project created in the tutorial, but for this guide, we'll assume that the Dagster project is the same as the one created in the tutorial.

It also assumes that you have installed a test runner like [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).

## Testing individual assets

We'll start by writing a test for the `topstories_word_cloud` asset definition, which is an image of a word cloud of the titles of top stories on Hacker News. To run the function that derives an asset from its upstream dependencies, we can invoke it directly, as if it's a regular Python function.

Add the following code to the `test_assets.py` file in your `tutorial_project_tests` directory:

```python
import pandas as pd
from tutorial_project.assets import topstories_word_cloud

def test_topstories_word_cloud():
    df = pd.DataFrame(
        [
            {"title": "Wow, Dagster is such an awesome and amazing product. I can't wait to use it!"},
            {"title": "Pied Piper launches new product"},
        ]
    )
    results = topstories_word_cloud(df)
    assert results is not None # It returned something
```

---

## Testing a graph of assets

We'll also write a test for all the assets together. To do that, we can put them in a list and then pass it to the <PyObject object="materialize" /> function. That returns an <PyObject object="ExecuteInProcessResult" /> object, whose methods let us investigate, in detail, the success or failure of execution, the values produced by the computation, and other events associated with execution.

Update the `test_assets.py` file to include the following code:

```python
from dagster import materialize
from tutorial_project.assets import (
    topstory_ids,
    topstories,
    topstories_word_cloud
) # Instead of importing one asset, import them all

def test_hackernews_assets():
    assets = [topstory_ids, topstories, topstories_word_cloud]
    result = materialize(assets)
    assert result.success
    df = result.output_for_node("topstories")
    assert len(df) == 100
```

---

## Running the tests

Use pytest, or your test runner of choice, to run the unit tests. Navigate to the top-level `tutorial_project` directory (the one that contains the `tutorial_project_tests` directory) and run:

```bash
pytest tutorial_project_tests
```

Wait a few seconds for the tests to run and observe the output in your terminal.
