# Testing

Dagster enables you to build testable and maintainable data applications. It provides ways to allow you unit-test your data applications, separate business logic from environments, and set explicit expectations on uncontrollable inputs.

## Overview

In data applications, testing computations and jobs is notoriously challenging. Because of this, they often go relatively untested before hitting production. If there is testing in place, these tests are often slow, not run during common developer workflows, and have limited value because of the inability to simulate conditions in the production environment.

We believe the underlying fact is that data applications encode much of their business logic in heavy, external systems. Examples include processing systems like Spark and data warehouses such as Snowflake and Redshift. It is difficult to structure software to isolate these dependencies or nearly impossible to run them in a lightweight manner.

This page demonstrates how Dagster addresses these challenges:

- It provides convenient ways to write [Unit Tests in Data Applications](#unit-tests-in-data-applications).
- It allows you to [Separate Business Logic from Environments](#separating-business-logic-from-environments) and, therefore, write lightweight tests.

## Unit Tests in Data Applications

Principal: Errors that can be caught by unit tests should be caught by unit tests.

Corollary: Do not attempt to unit test for errors that unit tests cannot catch.

Using unit tests without keeping these principles in mind is why the data community frequently treats unit tests with skepticism. It is too often interpreted as simulating an external system such as Spark or data warehouse in a granular manner. Those are very complex systems that are impossible to emulate faithfully. Do not try to do so.

Unit tests are not acceptance tests. They should not be the judge of whether a computation is correct. However, unit testing -- when properly scoped -- is still valuable in data applications. There are massive classes of errors that we can address without interacting with external services and catch earlier in the process: refactoring errors, syntax errors in interpreted languages, configuration errors, graph structure errors, and so on. Errors caught in a fast feedback loop of unit testing can be addressed orders of magnitude faster than those caught during an expensive batch computation in staging or production.

So, unit tests should be viewed primarily as productivity and code quality tools, leading to more correct calculations. Here we will demonstrate how Dagster conveniently enables unit tests.

### Testing a Job Execution

The workhorse function for unit-testing a job is the <PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process"/> function. Using this function you can execute a job in process and then test execution properties using the <PyObject object="ExecuteInProcessResult" /> object that it returns.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_job_marker endbefore=end_test_job_marker
def test_job():
    result = do_math_job.execute_in_process()

    # return type is ExecuteInProcessResult
    assert isinstance(result, ExecuteInProcessResult)
    assert result.success
    # inspect individual op result
    assert result.output_for_node("add_one") == 2
    assert result.output_for_node("add_two") == 3
    assert result.output_for_node("subtract") == -1
```

You can find more unit test examples in the [Examples](#examples) section below.

## Separating Business Logic from Environments

As noted above, data applications often rely on and encode their business logic in code that is executed by heavy, external dependencies. It means that it is easy and natural to couple your application to a single operating environment. However, then, if you do this, any testing requires your production environment.

To make local testing possible, you may structure your software to, as much as possible, cleanly separate this business logic from your operating environment. This is one of the reasons why Dagster flows through a context object throughout its entire computation.

Attached to the context is a set of user-defined [resources](/concepts/resources). Examples of resources include APIs to data warehouses, Spark clusters, s3 sessions, or some other external dependency or service. Each job contains a set of resources, and multiple jobs can be defined for a given dagster graph for each set of resources (production, local, testing, etc).

For example, in order to skip external dependencies in tests, you may find yourself needing to constantly comment and uncomment like:

```python file=/concepts/resources/tests.py startafter=start_test_before_marker endbefore=end_test_before_marker
from dagster import op


@op
def get_data_without_resource(context):
    dummy_data = [1, 2, 3]
    # Do not call external apis in tests
    # return call_api()
    return dummy_data
```

### Testing graphs

Dagster allows you to define multiple "jobs" from the same computation graph. With resources, you can modify the op above to:

```python file=/concepts/resources/tests.py startafter=start_test_after_marker endbefore=end_test_after_marker
from dagster import op, graph


@op(required_resource_keys={"api"})
def get_data(context):
    return context.resources.api.call()


@op
def do_something(context, data):
    output = process(data)
    return output


@graph
def download():
    do_something(get_data())


# The prod job for the download graph.
download_job = download.to_job(resource_defs={"api": api_client})
```

In this example, we define the business logic (i.e., jobs and ops) within a computation graph, independent of any particular environment. From this computation graph, we define a production job using the resources that define our production environment.

This is extremely helpful when it comes to testing. We can execute the computation graph with mocked versions of resources, since the computation graph is not tied to any particular enviroment. In order to mock the `api` resource, we use a helper method [`mock_resource`](/\_apidocs/resources#dagster.ResourceDefinition.mock_resource) from the <PyObject object="ResourceDefinition" /> class.

```python file=/concepts/resources/tests.py startafter=start_execution_marker endbefore=end_execution_marker
def test_local():

    # Since we have access to the computation graph independent of the set of resources, we can
    # test it locally.
    result = download.execute_in_process(
        resources={"api": ResourceDefinition.mock_resource()}
    )
    assert result.success


def run_in_prod():
    download_job.execute_in_process()
```

For more information, you can check out the [Resources](/concepts/resources) sections.

## Examples

### Testing ops

While using the `@op` decorator on a function does change its signature, the invocation mirrors closely the underlying decorated function.

Consider the following op.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_invocation_op_marker endbefore=end_invocation_op_marker
@op
def my_op_to_test():
    return 5
```

Since it has no arguments, we can invoke it directly.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_op_marker endbefore=end_test_op_marker
def test_op_with_invocation():
    assert my_op_to_test() == 5
```

Consider the following op with inputs.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_invocation_op_inputs_marker endbefore=end_invocation_op_inputs_marker
@op
def my_op_with_inputs(x, y):
    return x + y
```

We can directly provide values for these inputs to the invocation.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_op_with_inputs_marker endbefore=end_test_op_with_inputs_marker
def test_inputs_op_with_invocation():
    assert my_op_with_inputs(5, 6) == 11
```

If your op requires contextual information such as resources or config, this can be provided using the <PyObject module="dagster" object="build_op_context"/> function.

Consider the following op, which requires a resource `foo`.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_op_requires_foo_marker endbefore=end_op_requires_foo_marker
@op(required_resource_keys={"foo"})
def op_requires_foo(context):
    return f"found {context.resources.foo}"
```

We construct the context using <PyObject module="dagster" object="build_op_context"/>. Note how we can directly provide a resource instance, instead of having to create a mock resource definition.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_op_context_marker endbefore=end_test_op_context_marker
from dagster import build_op_context


def test_op_with_context():
    context = build_op_context(resources={"foo": "bar"})
    assert op_requires_foo(context) == "found bar"
```

We can also provide a resource definition to <PyObject module="dagster" object="build_op_context"/>. It does not have a `resource_config` argument, so any config should be supplied to the resource via the <PyObject module="dagster" object="ResourceDefinition" method="configured"/> API.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_resource_def_marker endbefore=end_test_resource_def_marker
@resource(config_schema={"my_str": str})
def my_foo_resource(context):
    return context.resource_config["my_str"]


def test_op_resource_def():
    context = build_op_context(
        resources={"foo": my_foo_resource.configured({"my_str": "bar"})}
    )
    assert op_requires_foo(context) == "found bar"
```

Note that when directly invoking ops, IO managers specified on inputs and outputs are not used.

### Testing software-defined assets

Similar to ops, <PyObject object="asset" decorator />-decorated functions can be directly invoked. Doing so invokes the underlying op computation.

A basic asset, with no dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_basic_asset endbefore=end_test_basic_asset
from dagster import asset


@asset
def basic_asset():
    return 5


# An example unit test for basic_asset.
def test_basic_asset():
    assert basic_asset() == 5
```

An asset with dependencies:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_input_asset endbefore=end_test_input_asset
from dagster import asset


@asset
def asset_with_inputs(x, y):
    return x + y


# An example unit test for asset_with_inputs.
def test_asset_with_inputs():
    assert asset_with_inputs(5, 6) == 11
```

Any resources defined on your asset - either directly, or using <PyObject object="with_resources" /> - will be picked up when invoking the asset. When using resources, it is required to provide a context using <PyObject object="build_op_context" />.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_resource_asset endbefore=end_test_resource_asset
from dagster import asset, resource, build_op_context, with_resources


@asset(required_resource_keys={"service"})
def asset_reqs_service(context):
    service = context.resources.service
    ...


@resource
def service():
    ...


# asset_with_service now has resource service specified.
asset_with_service = with_resources([asset_reqs_service], {"service": service})[0]


def test_asset_with_service():
    # When invoking asset_with_service, service resource will
    # automatically be used.
    result = asset_with_service(build_op_context())
    ...
```

Note that resources provided on <PyObject object="build_op_context" /> should not conflict with the resources provided directly on the asset. If a resource key is provided both to the context and the asset, it will result in a <PyObject object="DagsterInvalidInvocationError" />.

### Testing multiple software-defined assets together

You may want to test multiple assets together, to more closely mirror actual materialization. This can be done using the <PyObject object="materialize_to_memory" /> method, which loads the materialized results of assets into memory:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_materialize_asset endbefore=end_materialize_asset
from dagster import asset, materialize_to_memory


@asset
def data_source():
    return get_data_from_source()


@asset
def structured_data(data_source):
    return extract_structured_data(data_source)


# An example unit test using materialize_to_memory
def test_data_assets():
    result = materialize_to_memory([data_source, structured_data])
    assert result.success
    # Materialized objects can be accessed in terms of the underlying op
    materialized_data = result.output_for_node("structured_data")
    ...
```

Mock resources can be provided directly using `materialize_to_memory`:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_materialize_resources endbefore=end_materialize_resources
from dagster import asset, resource, materialize_to_memory
import mock


@asset(required_resource_keys={"service"})
def asset_requires_service(context):
    service = context.resources.service
    ...


def test_asset_requires_service():
    # Mock objects can be provided directly.
    result = materialize_to_memory(
        [asset_requires_service], resources={"service": mock.MagicMock()}
    )
    assert result.success
    ...
```

### Testing job execution with config

Sometimes, you may want to test with different configuration. You can execute job with a specified run config via the `run_config`:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_job_with_config endbefore=end_test_job_with_config
def test_job_with_config():
    result = do_math_job.execute_in_process(
        run_config={
            "ops": {
                "add_one": {"inputs": {"num": 2}},
                "add_two": {"inputs": {"num": 3}},
            }
        }
    )

    assert result.success

    assert result.output_for_node("add_one") == 3
    assert result.output_for_node("add_two") == 5
    assert result.output_for_node("subtract") == -2
```

### Testing event stream

The event stream is the most generic way that an op communicates what happened during its computation. Ops communicate events for starting, input/output type checking, and user-provided events such as expectations, materializations, and outputs.

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/unit_tests.py startafter=start_test_event_stream endbefore=end_test_event_stream
def test_event_stream():
    job_result = emit_events_job.execute_in_process(
        run_config={"ops": {"emit_events_op": {"inputs": {"input_num": 1}}}}
    )

    assert job_result.success

    # when one op has multiple outputs, you need to specify output name
    assert job_result.output_for_node("emit_events_op", output_name="a_num") == 2

    events_for_step = job_result.events_for_node("emit_events_op")
    assert [se.event_type for se in events_for_step] == [
        DagsterEventType.STEP_START,
        DagsterEventType.STEP_INPUT,
        DagsterEventType.STEP_EXPECTATION_RESULT,
        DagsterEventType.ASSET_MATERIALIZATION,
        DagsterEventType.STEP_OUTPUT,
        DagsterEventType.HANDLED_OUTPUT,
        DagsterEventType.STEP_SUCCESS,
    ]

    # ops communicate what they did via the event stream, viewable in tools (e.g. dagit)
    (
        _start,
        _input_event,
        expectation_event,
        materialization_event,
        _num_output_event,
        _num_handled_output_operation,
        _success,
    ) = events_for_step

    # apologies for verboseness here! we can do better.
    expectation_result = expectation_event.event_specific_data.expectation_result
    assert isinstance(expectation_result, ExpectationResult)
    assert expectation_result.success
    assert expectation_result.label == "positive"

    materialization = materialization_event.event_specific_data.materialization
    assert isinstance(materialization, AssetMaterialization)
    assert materialization.label == "persisted_string"
```

### Testing jobs with top-level inputs

You can wire inputs from the top-level of a job to the constituent ops. Consider the following op and graph:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/jobs.py startafter=start_top_level_input_graph endbefore=end_top_level_input_graph
from dagster import graph, op


@op
def op_with_input(x):
    return do_something(x)


@graph
def wires_input(x):
    op_with_input(x)
```

Turn the graph into a job by calling <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="to_job" />, and provide a value to the input `x` using the `input_values` argument:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/jobs.py startafter=start_top_level_input_job endbefore=end_top_level_input_job
the_job = wires_input.to_job(input_values={"x": 5})
```

You can also provide input values using <PyObject object="JobDefinition" method="execute_in_process" /> or <PyObject object="GraphDefinition" method="execute_in_process" />:

```python file=/concepts/ops_jobs_graphs/jobs.py startafter=start_execute_in_process_input endbefore=end_execute_in_process_input
graph_result = wires_input.execute_in_process(input_values={"x": 5})

job_result = the_job.execute_in_process(
    input_values={"x": 6}
)  # Overrides existing input value
```
