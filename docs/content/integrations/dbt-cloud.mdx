# Using dbt Cloud with Dagster

Dagster allows you to run dbt Cloud alongside other technologies like Spark, Python, etc., and has built-in support for loading dbt Cloud models, seeds, and snapshots as [software-defined assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets).

---

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to install the `dagster` and `dagster-dbt` Python packages:

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-dbt
```

You'll also want to have a dbt Cloud instance with an existing project that is deployed with a dbt Cloud job. If you don't have one already, you can [set up dbt Cloud with a sample project](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started/set-up-dbt-cloud).

To manage the dbt Cloud job from Dagster, you'll need three values:

1. An `auth_token` for connecting with the dbt Cloud API, stored in an environment variable `DBT_CLOUD_API_TOKEN`,
2. The `account_id` of your dbt Cloud account, stored in an environment variable `DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID`, and
3. The `job_id` of the dbt Cloud job you want to manage in Dagster

The `auth_token` can also be found by generating a [Service account token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-api/service-tokens) in the dbt Cloud console.

The `account_id` and `job_id` can be obtained by inspecting the URL of the dbt Cloud job in the dbt Cloud console. For example, in this screenshot, the `account_id` is `111111` and the `job_id` is `33333`.

## Step 1: Connecting to dbt Cloud

The first step in using dbt Cloud with Dagster is to tell Dagster how to connect to your dbt Cloud instance using a dbt Cloud [resource](/concepts/resources). This resource contains information on where the dbt Cloud instance is located and any credentials sourced from environment variables that are needed to access it.

```python startafter=start_define_dbt_cloud_instance endbefore=end_define_dbt_cloud_instance file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_cloud.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cloud_resource

dbt_cloud_instance = dbt_cloud_resource.configured(
    {
        "auth_token": {"env": "DBT_CLOUD_API_TOKEN"},
        "account_id": {"env": "DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID"},
    }
)
```

## Step 2: Loading dbt Cloud models as assets

In this step, you'll load the dbt Cloud models managed by a dbt Cloud job into Dagster as assets. For context, a dbt Cloud job defines set of commands to run for a dbt Cloud project. The dbt Cloud models managed by a dbt Cloud job are the models that are run by the job after filtering options are respected.

Using our dbt Cloud resource, we can retrieve information about the models that the dbt Cloud job is managing.

```python startafter=start_load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job endbefore=end_load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_cloud.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job

# Use the dbt_cloud_instance resource we defined in Step 1, and the job_id from Prerequisites
dbt_cloud_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job(
    dbt_cloud=dbt_cloud_instance,
    job_id=33333,
)
```

<Note>
  We currently require that your dbt Cloud job only has one command: one of
  either `dbt run` or `dbt build`, along with any optional command line
  arguments.
</Note>

The <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job" /> function loads the dbt Cloud models into Dagster as assets, creating one Dagster asset for each model.

When invoked, the function:

1. Invokes your dbt Cloud job with command overrides to compile your dbt project,
2. Parses the metadata provided by dbt Cloud, and
3. Generates a set of software-defined assets reflecting the models in the project managed by the dbt Cloud job. Materializing these assets will run the dbt Cloud job that is represented by the loaded assets.

## Step 3: Schedule dbt Cloud job runs

Now that your dbt Cloud assets are loaded, you can define a Dagster job that materializes some or all of these assets, triggering the underlying dbt Cloud job.

You can explicitly define when your assets should be materialized. For example, you can schedule assets based on their upstream or downstream dependencies, external events using a sensor, or a cron schedule.

```python startafter=start_schedule_dbt_cloud_assets endbefore=end_schedule_dbt_cloud_assets file=/integrations/dbt/dbt_cloud.py dedent=4
from dagster import ScheduleDefinition, define_asset_job, repository, AssetSelection

# Materialize all assets in the repository
run_everything_job = define_asset_job("run_everything_job", AssetSelection.all())

@repository
def my_repo():
    return [
        # Use the dbt_cloud_assets defined in Step 2
        dbt_cloud_assets,
        ScheduleDefinition(
            job=run_everything_job,
            cron_schedule="@daily",
        ),
    ]
```

## What's next?

By now, you should have a working dbt Cloud and Dagster integration and a handful of materialized Dagster assets.
