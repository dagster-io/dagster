# Airlift

Airlift is a toolkit for integrating Dagster and Airflow.

- Observe Airflow instances from within Dagster
- Accelerate the migration of Airflow DAGs to Dagster assets with opinionated tooling.

## Compatibility

### REST API Availability

Airlift depends on the availability of Airflow’s REST API. Airflow’s REST API was made stable in its 2.0 release (Dec 2020) and was introduced experimentally in 1.10 in August 2018. Currently Airflow requires the availability of the REST API.

- **OSS:** Stable as of 2.00
- **MWAA**
  - Note: only available in Airflow 2.4.3 or later on MWAA.
- **Cloud Composer:** No limitations as far as we know.
- **Astronomer:** No limitations as far as we know.

## Airflow Migration Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll use `dagster-airlift` to migrate an Airflow DAG to Dagster assets.

By the end of the tutorial, you'll understand how to use `dagster-airlift` to enable a migration process that

- Can be done task-by-task in any order with minimal coordination
- Has task-by-task rollback to reduce risk
- Retains Airflow DAG structure and execution history during the migration
