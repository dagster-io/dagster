# Learning Dagster from Airflow

In this tutorial, we'll help you make the switch from Airflow to Dagster. Here, we review an Airflow DAG and show how the same functionality and be achieved in Dagster.

## Comparing an Airflow Dag to Dagster

In this guide we will rewrite an [Airflow DAG](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/fundamentals.html) as a Dagster [Job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs). Starting with a basic Airflow DAG:

```python file=/integrations/airflow/dags/tutorial.py
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from textwrap import dedent

from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator

with DAG(
    "tutorial",
    default_args={
        "retries": 1,
    },
    description="A simple tutorial DAG",
    schedule=timedelta(days=1),
    start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
    tags=["example"],
) as dag:

    t1 = BashOperator(
        task_id="print_date",
        bash_command="date",
    )

    t2 = BashOperator(
        task_id="sleep",
        bash_command="sleep 5",
        retries=3,
    )

    templated_command = dedent(
        """
    {% for i in range(5) %}
        echo "{{ ds }}"
        echo "{{ macros.ds_add(ds, 7)}}"
    {% endfor %}
    """
    )

    t3 = BashOperator(
        task_id="templated",
        bash_command=templated_command,
    )

    t1 >> [t2, t3]
```

In order to rewrite this DAG in Dagster we will break it down into three parts

1. Define the computations: "the ops" - in Airflow, the operators
2. Define the graph: the job - in Airflow, the DAG
3. Define the schedule - In Airflow, the schedule (how simple!)

A [Job](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs) is made up of a [Graph](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/graphs) of [Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops). If you've used the Airflow taskflow api this will feel familiar, With ops you will be focused on writing a graph with python functions as the nodes with the data dependencies between those as edges.

### Step 1: Defining the Ops

In Dagster, the minimum unit of computation is an op. This directly corresponds to an operator in Airflow. Here, we map the Airflow operators `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` to their respective Dagster op's.

```python file=/integrations/airflow/tutorial_rewrite_dagster.py startafter=start_ops endbefore=end_ops
@op
def print_date(context) -> datetime:
    ds = datetime.now()
    context.log.info(ds)
    return ds


@op(retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3), ins={"start": In(Nothing)})
def sleep():
    time.sleep(5)


@op
def templated(context, ds: datetime):
    for _i in range(5):
        context.log.info(ds)
        context.log.info(ds - timedelta(days=7))
```

this yields us the following graph of computations

    width={2200}
    height={1300}
  />
</center>

##### Op Level Retries

In the tutorial DAG, the `t2` operator allowed for 3 retries. To configure the same behavior in Dagster, you can use [op level retry policies](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-retries)

### Step 2: Defining the Job

In Dagster, the computations defined in `op`s are composed in `job`s, which define the sequence and dependency structure of the computations you want to execute. This directly corresponds to a DAG in Airflow. Here, we compose the `op`s `print_date`, `sleep` and `templated` to match the dependency structure defined by the Airflow operators `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`.\`\`\`

```python file=/integrations/airflow/tutorial_rewrite_dagster.py startafter=start_job endbefore=end_job
@job(tags={"dagster/max_retries": 1, "dag_name": "example"})
def tutorial_job():
    ds = print_date()
    sleep(ds)
    templated(ds)
```

##### Job Level Retries

Job level retries are managed by the [run launcher](/deployment/run-retries) you will need to enable support for them in your dagster.yaml, once you do you can define the retry count on the job.

### Step 3: Defining the schedule

In Dagster Schedules are defined seperately from your computations, Below we define a schedule that will run the `tutorial_job` daily:

```python file=/integrations/airflow/tutorial_rewrite_dagster.py startafter=start_schedule endbefore=end_schedule
schedule = ScheduleDefinition(job=tutorial_job, cron_schedule="@daily")
```

### Step 4: Running locally

In order to run our newly defined Dagster Job we'll need to define a Dagster [Repository](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories). A Dagster Repository is a logical grouping of Jobs and Schedules that provides an entrypoint for viewing and executing Jobs.

```python file=/integrations/airflow/tutorial_rewrite_dagster.py startafter=start_repo endbefore=end_repo
@repository
def rewrite_repo():
    return [tutorial_job, schedule]
```

We can now load this file with dagit, the interactive web-ui for dagster

```bash
dagit -f <your_dagster_file>.py
```

## Completed Code Example

```python file=/integrations/airflow/tutorial_rewrite_complete.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
import time
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from dagster import (
    In,
    Nothing,
    RetryPolicy,
    ScheduleDefinition,
    job,
    op,
    repository,
    schedule,
)


@op
def print_date(context) -> datetime:
    ds = datetime.now()
    context.log.info(ds)
    return ds


@op(retry_policy=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3), ins={"start": In(Nothing)})
def sleep():
    time.sleep(5)


@op
def templated(context, ds: datetime):
    for _i in range(5):
        context.log.info(ds)
        context.log.info(ds - timedelta(days=7))


@job(tags={"dagster/max_retries": 1, "dag_name": "example"})
def tutorial_job():
    ds = print_date()
    sleep(ds)
    templated(ds)


schedule = ScheduleDefinition(job=tutorial_job, cron_schedule="@daily")


@repository
def rewrite_repo():
    return [tutorial_job, schedule]
```
