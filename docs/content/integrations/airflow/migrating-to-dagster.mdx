Dagster can convert your Airflow DAGs into Dagster jobs, enabling a lift-and-shift migration from Airflow to Dagster without any rewriting.

This guide will walk you through the steps of doing this migration.

---

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to install the `dagster` and `dagster-airflow` Python packages:

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-airflow
```

---

## Step 1: Create a new repository using make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path

The first step to migrating is to define a Dagster repository. To do this, we'll use <PyObject module="dagster_airflow" object="make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path" /> and pass it the file path of our Airflow Dag Bag. Dagster will then load the DagBag and convert all DAGs into Dagster jobs.

```python file=/integrations/airflow/migrate_repo.py
import os

from dagster_airflow import make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path

migrated_airflow_repo = make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path(
    os.path.join(os.getenv("AIRFLOW_HOME"), "dags"),
    "migrated_airflow_repo",
)
```

Under the hood, Dagster is running the exact operator code as you were in Airflow. You will be able to view your normal Airflow `stdout`/`stderr` logs as compute logs in Dagit.

---

## Step 2: Define your Airflow connections

By default, each job run of your migrated DAGs creates an ephemeral airflow metadatabase scoped to each job run. This means any [Airflow connections](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/connection.html) that your DAG depends on will need to be created. To do this, you can provide a `connections` parameter to <PyObject module="dagster_airflow" object="make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path" />:

```python file=/integrations/airflow/migrate_repo_connections.py
import os

from airflow.models import Connection
from dagster_airflow import make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path

migrated_airflow_repo = make_dagster_repo_from_airflow_dags_path(
    os.path.join(os.getenv("AIRFLOW_HOME"), "dags"),
    "migrated_airflow_repo",
    connections=[
        Connection(conn_id="http_default", conn_type="uri", host="https://google.com")
    ],
)
```

If you're running on Dagster Cloud and any of your connection fields are sensitive, you can securely pass them in using [environment variables](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets).

---

## Step 3: Run your migrated DAGs locally

Once you've defined the repository, you can launch Dagit, Dagster's web UI. This allows you to view your newly migrated jobs and launch runs.

```bash
dagit -f <your migrated dags>.py
```

If your local shell has the correct permissions, you can also test out running the migrated DAGs end-to-end.

---

## Step 4: Setup your permissions

Your Airflow instance likely had specific IAM or Kubernetes permissions that allowed it to successfully run your Airflow DAGs. In order to run the migrated Dagster jobs, you'll need to duplicate these permissions for Dagster.

- **Using [Airflow connections](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/connection.html) or [environment variables](/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables-and-secrets)** are the easiest methods for defining permissions.

- **If your Airflow DAGs used [`KubernetesPodOperators`](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes/stable/operators.html)**, it's possible that you used the `in_cluster` config or loading a `kube_config` file. When migrating, we recommend switching to [using connections with a `kube_config` JSON blob](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes/stable/connections/kubernetes.html) to make things easier.
