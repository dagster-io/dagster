# Using Fivetran with Dagster

Dagster can orchestrate your Fivetran connectors, making it easy to chain a Fivetran sync with upstream or downstream steps in your workflow.

This guide focuses on how to work with Fivetran connectors using Dagster's [software-defined asset (SDA)](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) framework.

## Fivetran connectors and Dagster software-defined assets

A [Fivetran connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/core-concepts) defines a series of schemas and tables which are synced between a source and a destination. During a sync, data is retrieved from the source and written to the destination as one or more tables. Dagster represents each of the replicas generated in the destination as a software-defined asset. This enables you to easily:

- Visualize the schemas and tables involved in a Fivetran connector and execute a sync from Dagster
- Define downstream computations which depend on replicas produced by Fivetran
- Track historical metadata and logs for each table
- Track data lineage through Fivetran and other tools

---

## Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to install the `dagster` and `dagster-fivetran` Python packages:

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-fivetran
```

You'll also want to have set up [a Fivetran instance](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started) and have a Fivetran [API key and API secret](https://fivetran.com/docs/rest-api/getting-started), which can be generated by a Fivetran Account Administrator.

---

## Step 1: Connecting to Fivetran

The first step in using Fivetran with Dagster is to tell Dagster how to connect to your Fivetran instance using a Fivetran [resource](/concepts/resources). This resource contains the credentials needed to access your Fivetran instance.

We will supply our credentials as environment variables. For more information on setting environment variables in a production setting, see [Using environment variables and secrets](/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets).

```bash
export FIVETRAN_API_KEY=...
export FIVETRAN_API_SECRET=...
```

Then, we can instruct Dagster to authorize the Fivetran resource using the environment variables:

```python startafter=start_define_instance endbefore=end_define_instance file=/integrations/fivetran/fivetran.py dedent=4
from dagster_fivetran import fivetran_resource

# Pull API key and secret from environment variables
fivetran_instance = fivetran_resource.configured(
    {
        "api_key": {"env": "FIVETRAN_API_KEY"},
        "api_secret": {"env": "FIVETRAN_API_SECRET"},
    }
)
```

For more information on the additional configuration options available for the Fivetran resource, see the [API reference](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-fivetran#dagster_fivetran.fivetran_resource).

## Step 2: Loading Fivetran asset definitions into Dagster

The easiest way to get started using Fivetran with Dagster is to have Dagster automatically generate asset defintions from your Fivetran project. You can [load asset definitions from a Fivetran instance via API](#loading-fivetran-asset-definitions-from-a-fivetran-instance), at initialization time.

You can also [manually-build asset definitions](#manually-building-fivetran-asset-definitions) on a per-connector basis.

<TabGroup>

<TabItem name="Loading from Fivetran instance">

### Loading Fivetran asset definitions from a Fivetran instance

To load Fivetran assets into Dagster from your Fivetran instance, you will need to supply the Fivetran resource that we defined above in step 1. Here, the Fivetran instance is treated as the source of truth.

```python startafter=start_load_assets_from_fivetran_instance endbefore=end_load_assets_from_fivetran_instance file=/integrations/fivetran/fivetran.py dedent=4
from dagster_fivetran import load_assets_from_fivetran_instance

# Use the fivetran_instance resource we defined in Step 1
fivetran_assets = load_assets_from_fivetran_instance(fivetran_instance)
```

The `load_assets_from_fivetran_instance` function retrieves all of the connectors you have defined in the Fivetran interface, creating software-defined assets for each generated table. Each connector has an associated [op](https://docs.dagster.io/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops#ops) which triggers a sync of that connector.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Manually building assets">

### Manually building Fivetran asset definitions

Instead of having Dagster automatically create the asset defintions for your Fivetran instance, you can opt to individually build them. First, determine the Connector IDs for each of the connectors you would like to build assets for. The Connector ID can be found on the Setup page for each connector in the Fivetran UI:

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Screenshot of the Fivetran UI in a browser, showing the connector ID in the settings page."
    src="/images/integrations/fivetran/fivetran_connector_id.png"
    width={772}
    height={500}
  />
</center>

Then, supply the Connector ID and the list of tables which the connector creates in the destination to `build_fivetran_assets`, each in the format `{schema_name}.{table_name}`:

```python startafter=start_manually_define_fivetran_assets endbefore=end_manually_define_fivetran_assets file=/integrations/fivetran/fivetran.py dedent=4
from dagster_fivetran import build_fivetran_assets

fivetran_assets = build_fivetran_assets(
    connector_id="omit_constitutional",
    destination_tables=["public.survey_responses", "public.surveys"],
)
```

#### Adding a resource

Manually-built Fivetran assets require a `fivetran_resource`, which defines how to connect and interact with your Fivetran instance.

We can add the Fivetran resource we configured above to our Fivetran assets by doing the following:

```python startafter=start_fivetran_manual_config endbefore=end_fivetran_manual_config file=/integrations/fivetran/fivetran.py dedent=4
from dagster_fivetran import build_fivetran_assets

from dagster import with_resources

fivetran_assets = with_resources(
    build_fivetran_assets(
        connector_id="omit_constitutional",
        destination_tables=["public.survey_responses", "public.surveys"],
    ),
    # Use the fivetran_instance resource we defined in Step 1
    {"fivetran": fivetran_instance},
)
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Step 3: Adding downstream assets

<Note>
  Looking to orchestrate Fivetran with dbt? Check out our{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt">dbt integration docs</a>.
</Note>

Once you have loaded your Fivetran assets into Dagster, you can create assets which depend on them. These can be other assets pulled in from external sources such as [dbt](/integrations/dbt) or assets defined in Python code.

In this case, we have a Fivetran connector which is storing data in the `public.survey_responses` table in our Snowflake warehouse. The corresponding asset key is `public/survey_responses`. We specify the output [IO manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers) to tell downstream assets how to retreive the data.

```python startafter=start_add_downstream_assets endbefore=end_add_downstream_assets file=/integrations/fivetran/fivetran.py dedent=4
import json
from dagster import asset, repository, with_resources, AssetIn, AssetKey
from dagster_fivetran import load_assets_from_fivetran_instance

fivetran_assets = load_assets_from_fivetran_instance(
    fivetran_instance,
    io_manager_key="snowflake_io_manager",
)

@asset(
    ins={"survey_responses": AssetIn(key=AssetKey("public", "survey_responses"))}
)
def survey_responses_file(survey_responses):
    with open("survey_responses.json", "w", encoding="utf8") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(survey_responses, indent=2))

@repository
def my_repo():
    return [
        with_resources(
            [fivetran_assets, survey_responses_file],
            {"snowflake_io_manager": snowflake_io_manager},
        )
    ]
```

---

## Step 4: Scheduling Fivetran syncs

Once you have Fivetran assets, you can define a job that runs some or all of these assets on a schedule, triggering the underlying Fivetran sync.

```python startafter=start_schedule_assets endbefore=end_schedule_assets file=/integrations/fivetran/fivetran.py dedent=4
from dagster import ScheduleDefinition, define_asset_job, repository, AssetSelection

# materialize all assets in the repository
run_everything_job = define_asset_job("run_everything", selection="*")

# only run my_fivetran_connection and downstream assets
my_etl_job = define_asset_job(
    "my_etl_job", AssetSelection.groups("my_fivetran_connection").downstream()
)

@repository
def my_repo():
    return [
        fivetran_assets,
        ScheduleDefinition(
            job=my_etl_job,
            cron_schedule="@daily",
        ),
        ScheduleDefinition(
            job=run_everything_job,
            cron_schedule="@weekly",
        ),
    ]
```

Refer to the [Schedule documentation](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules#running-the-scheduler) for more info on running jobs on a schedule.
