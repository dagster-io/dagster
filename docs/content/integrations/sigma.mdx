# Using Dagster with Sigma

<ExperimentalCallout />

This guide provides instructions for using Dagster with Sigma using the `dagster-sigma` library. Your Sigma assets, including datasets and workbooks, can be represented in the Dagster asset graph, allowing you to track lineage and dependencies between Sigma assets and upstream data assets you are already modeling in Dagster.

## What you'll learn

- How to represent Sigma assets in the Dagster asset graph, including lineage to other Dagster assets.
- How to customize asset definition metadata for these Sigma assets.

<details>
  <summary>Prerequisites</summary>

- The `dagster-sigma` library installed in your environment
- Familiarity with asset definitions and the Dagster asset graph
- Familiarity with Dagster resources
- Familiarity with Sigma concepts, like datasets and workbooks
- A Sigma organization
- A Sigma client ID and client secret. For more information, see [Generate API client credentials](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/generate-client-credentials#generate-api-client-credentials) in the Sigma documentation.

</details>

## Set up your environment

To get started, you'll need to install the `dagster` and `dagster-sigma` Python packages:

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-sigma
```

## Represent Sigma assets in the asset graph

To load Sigma assets into the Dagster asset graph, you must first construct a <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="SigmaOrganization" /> resource, which allows Dagster to communicate with your Sigma organization. You'll need to supply your client ID and client secret alongside the base URL. See [Identify your API request URL](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/get-started-sigma-api#identify-your-api-request-url) in the Sigma documentation for more information on how to find your base URL.

Dagster can automatically load all datasets and workbooks from your Sigma workspace as asset specs. Call the <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" method="load_sigma_asset_specs" /> function, which returns list of <PyObject object="AssetSpec" />s representing your Sigma assets. You can then include these asset specs in your <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object:

```python file=/integrations/sigma/representing-sigma-assets.py
from dagster_sigma import SigmaBaseUrl, SigmaOrganization, load_sigma_asset_specs

import dagster as dg

sigma_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

sigma_specs = load_sigma_asset_specs(sigma_organization)
defs = dg.Definitions(assets=[*sigma_specs], resources={"sigma": sigma_organization})
```

## Load Sigma assets from filtered workbooks

It is possible to load a subset of your Sigma assets by providing a <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" method="SigmaFilter" /> to the <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" method="load_sigma_asset_specs" /> function. This `SigmaFilter` object allows you to specify the folders from which you want to load Sigma workbooks, and also will allow you to configure which datasets are represented as assets.

Note that the content and size of Sigma organization may affect the performance of your Dagster deployments. Filtering the workbooks selection from which your Sigma assets will be loaded is particularly useful for improving loading times.

```python file=/integrations/sigma/filtering-sigma-assets.py
from dagster_sigma import (
    SigmaBaseUrl,
    SigmaFilter,
    SigmaOrganization,
    load_sigma_asset_specs,
)

import dagster as dg

sigma_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

sigma_specs = load_sigma_asset_specs(
    organization=sigma_organization,
    sigma_filter=SigmaFilter(
        # Filter down to only the workbooks in these folders
        workbook_folders=[
            ("my_folder", "my_subfolder"),
            ("my_folder", "my_other_subfolder"),
        ],
        # Specify whether to include datasets that are not used in any workbooks
        # default is True
        include_unused_datasets=False,
    ),
)
defs = dg.Definitions(assets=[*sigma_specs], resources={"sigma": sigma_organization})
```

### Customize asset definition metadata for Sigma assets

By default, Dagster will generate asset specs for each Sigma asset based on its type, and populate default metadata. You can further customize asset properties by passing a custom <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="DagsterSigmaTranslator" /> subclass to the <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" method="load_sigma_asset_specs" /> function. This subclass can implement methods to customize the asset specs for each Sigma asset type.

```python file=/integrations/sigma/customize-sigma-asset-defs.py
from dagster_sigma import (
    DagsterSigmaTranslator,
    SigmaBaseUrl,
    SigmaOrganization,
    SigmaWorkbookTranslatorData,
    load_sigma_asset_specs,
)

import dagster as dg

sigma_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)


# A translator class lets us customize properties of the built Sigma assets, such as the owners or asset key
class MyCustomSigmaTranslator(DagsterSigmaTranslator):
    def get_asset_spec(self, data: SigmaWorkbookTranslatorData) -> dg.AssetSpec:
        # We create the default asset spec using super()
        default_spec = super().get_asset_spec(data)
        # we customize the team owner tag for all Sigma assets
        return default_spec.replace_attributes(owners=["team:my_team"])


sigma_specs = load_sigma_asset_specs(
    sigma_organization, dagster_sigma_translator=MyCustomSigmaTranslator()
)
defs = dg.Definitions(assets=[*sigma_specs], resources={"sigma": sigma_organization})
```

Note that `super()` is called in each of the overridden methods to generate the default asset spec. It is best practice to generate the default asset spec before customizing it.

### Load Sigma assets from multiple organizations

Definitions from multiple Sigma organizations can be combined by instantiating multiple <PyObject module="dagster_sigma" object="SigmaOrganization" /> resources and merging their specs. This lets you view all your Sigma assets in a single asset graph:

```python file=/integrations/sigma/multiple-sigma-organizations.py
from dagster_sigma import SigmaBaseUrl, SigmaOrganization, load_sigma_asset_specs

import dagster as dg

sales_team_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("SALES_SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("SALES_SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

marketing_team_organization = SigmaOrganization(
    base_url=SigmaBaseUrl.AWS_US,
    client_id=dg.EnvVar("MARKETING_SIGMA_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret=dg.EnvVar("MARKETING_SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET"),
)

sales_team_specs = load_sigma_asset_specs(sales_team_organization)
marketing_team_specs = load_sigma_asset_specs(marketing_team_organization)

# Merge the specs into a single set of definitions
defs = dg.Definitions(
    assets=[*sales_team_specs, *marketing_team_specs],
    resources={
        "marketing_sigma": marketing_team_organization,
        "sales_sigma": sales_team_organization,
    },
)
```
