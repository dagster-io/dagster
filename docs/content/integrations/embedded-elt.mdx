# Dagster Embedded ELT

This package provides a framework for building ELT pipelines with Dagster through helpful pre-built assets and resources. It is currently in experimental development, and we'd love to hear your feedback.

This package currently includes a single implementation using <a href="https://slingdata.io">Sling</a>, which provides a simple way to sync data between databases and file systems.

We plan on adding additional embedded ELT tool integrations in the future.

## Getting started

To get started with `dagster-embedded-elt` and Sling, familiarize yourself with <a href="https://docs.slingdata.io/sling-cli/running-tasks">Sling</a> by reading their docs which describe how sources and targets are configured.

The typical pattern for building an ELT pipeline with Sling has three steps:

1. First, create a <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="SlingResource" /> which is a container for the source and the target.
2. In the <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="SlingResource" /> define both a <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="SlingSourceConnection" /> and a <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="SlingTargetConnection" /> which holds the source and target credentials that Sling will use to sync data.
3. Finally, create an asset that syncs between two connections. You can use the <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="build_sling_asset" /> factory for most use cases.

## Step 1: Setting up a Sling resource

A Sling resource is a Dagster resource that contains references to both a source connection and a target connection. Sling is versatile in what a source or destination can represent. You can provide arbitrary keywords to the <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="SlingSourceConnection" /> and <PyObject module="dagster-embedded-elt.sling" object="SlingTargetConnection" /> classes.

The types and parameters for each connection are defined by [Sling's connections](https://docs.slingdata.io/connections/database-connections).

The simplest connection is a file connection, which can be defined as:

```python
from dagster_embedded_elt.sling import SlingSourceConnection
source = SlingSourceConnection(type="file")
sling = SlingResource(source_connection=source, ...)
```

Note that no path is required in the source connection, as that is provided by the asset itself.

````python
asset_def = build_sling_asset(
    asset_spec=AssetSpec("my_file"),
    source_stream=f"file://{path_to_file}",
    ...
)

For database connections, you can provide a connection string or a dictionary of keyword arguments. For example, to connect to a SQLite database, you can provide a path to the database using the `instance` keyword, which is specified in [Sling's SQLite connection](https://docs.slingdata.io/connections/database-connections/sqlite) documentation.

```python
source = SlingSourceConnection(type="sqlite", instance="path/to/sqlite.db")
````

---

## Step 2: Creating a Sling sync

To create a Sling sync, once you have defined your resource, you can use the <PyObject module="dagster_embedded_elt.sling" object="build_sling_asset" /> factory to create an asset.

```python

sling_resource = SlingResource(
    source_connection=SlingSourceConnection(type="file"),
    target_connection=SlingTargetConnection(
        type="sqlite", connection_string="sqlite://path/to/sqlite.db"
    ),
)

asset_spec = AssetSpec(
    key=["main", "tbl"],
    group_name="etl",
    description="ETL Test",
    deps=["foo"],
)

asset_def = build_sling_asset(
    asset_spec=asset_spec,
    source_stream="file://path/to/file.csv",
    target_object="main.dest_tbl",
    mode=SlingMode.INCREMENTAL,
    primary_key="id",
)

sling_job = build_assets_job(
    "sling_job",
    [asset_def],
    resource_defs={"sling": sling_resource},
)

```

## Examples

This is an example of how to setup a Sling sync between Postgres and Snowflake:

```python
import os
from dagster_embedded_elt.sling import SlingResource, SlingSourceConnection, SlingTargetConnection

source = SlingSourceConnection(
    type="postgres", host="localhost", port=5432, database="my_database",
    user="my_user", password=os.getenv("PG_PASS")
)

target = SlingTargetConnection(
    type="snowflake", host="hostname.snowflake", user="username",
    database="database", password=os.getenv("SF_PASSWORD"), role="role"
)

sling = SlingResource(source_connection=source, target_connection=target)
```

Similarily, you can define file/storage connections:

```python
source = SlingSourceConnection(
    type="s3", bucket="sling-bucket",
    access_key_id=os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID"),
    secret_access_key=os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
)
```
