# Using Dagster with Airflow

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/with_airflow" />

The [`dagster-airflow`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-airflow) package provides interoperability between Dagster and Airflow. The main scenarios for using the Dagster Airflow integration are:

- You want to do a lift-and-shift migration of all your existing Airflow DAGs into Dagster Jobs/SDAs
- You want to trigger Dagster job runs from Airflow

This integration is designed to help support users who have existing Airflow usage and are looking to explore using Dagster.

## Airflow vs Dagster concept map

While Airflow and Dagster have some significant differences, there are many concepts that overlap. To ease the transition, we recommend using this cheatsheet to understand how Airflow concepts map to Dagster.
