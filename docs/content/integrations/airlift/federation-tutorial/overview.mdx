# Airflow Federation Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates using `dagster-airlift` to observe DAGs from multiple Airflow instances, and federate execution between them using Dagster as a centralized control plane.

Using `dagster-airlift` we can

- Observe Airflow DAGs and their execution history
- Directly trigger Airflow DAGs from Dagster
- Set up federated execution _across_ Airflow instances

All of this can be done with no changes to Airflow code.

## Overview

This tutorial will take you through an imaginary data platform team that has the following scenario:

- An Airflow instance `warehouse`, run by another team, that is responsible for loading data into a data warehouse.
- An Airflow instance `metrics`, run by the data platform team, that deploys all the metrics constructed by data scientists on top of the data warehouse.

Two DAGs have been causing a lot of pain lately for the team: `warehouse.load_customers` and `metrics.customer_metrics`. The `warehouse.load_customers` DAG is responsible for loading customer data into the data warehouse, and the `metrics.customer_metrics` DAG is responsible for computing metrics on top of the customer data. There's a cross-instance dependency relationship between these two DAGs, but it's not observable or controllable. The data platform team would ideally _only_ like to rebuild the `metrics.customer_metrics` DAG when the `warehouse.load_customers` DAG has new data. In this guide, we'll use `dagster-airlift` to observe the `warehouse` and `metrics` Airflow instances, and set up a federated execution controlled by Dagster that only triggers the `metrics.customer_metrics` DAG when the `warehouse.load_customers` DAG has new data. This process won't require any changes to the Airflow code.
