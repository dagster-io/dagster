## Loading dbt models from a dbt project

The `dagster-dbt` library offers two methods of loading dbt models from a project into Dagster:

- **For smaller dbt projects** where compilation time isn't a concern, we recommend the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> function, or
- **For larger dbt projects**, we recommend the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_manifest" /> function to load from an existing dbt `manifest.json` file

### Loading models using load_assets_from_dbt_project

<Note>
  Check out{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two">
    part two of the dbt + Dagster tutorial
  </a>{" "}
  to see this concept in context.
</Note>

For smaller dbt projects where compilation time is not a concern, the simplest way to load your dbt assets into Dagster is the following:

```python startafter=start_load_assets_from_dbt_project endbefore=end_load_assets_from_dbt_project file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_project

dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_project(project_dir="path/to/dbt/project")
```

The <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> function:

1. Compiles your dbt project,
2. Parses the metadata that dbt provides, and
3. Generates a set of software-defined assets that reflect the models in the project. These assets will share the same underlying operation, which will invoke dbt to run the models represented by the loaded assets.

### Loading models using load_assets_from_dbt_manifest

For larger dbt projects, the overhead involved with recompiling the entire project may be a concern. In these cases, you can load dbt models from an existing dbt `manifest.json` file using the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_manifest" /> function:

```python startafter=start_load_assets_from_dbt_manifest endbefore=end_load_assets_from_dbt_manifest file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
import json

from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_manifest

dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_manifest(
    json.load("path/to/dbt/manifest.json", encoding="utf8"),
)
```

**Note:** if you make any changes to your dbt project that change the structure of the project (such as changing the dependencies of a model or adding a new one), you'll need to regenerate your manifest file for those changes to be reflected in Dagster.

## Using the dbt_cli_resource for dbt CLI commands

<Note>
  Check out{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three">
    part three of the dbt + Dagster tutorial
  </a>{" "}
  to see this concept in context.
</Note>

Assets loaded from dbt require a dbt resource, which is responsible for firing off dbt CLI commands. The `dagster-dbt` integration provides the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_cli_resource" /> for this purpose. This resource can be configured with CLI flags that are passed into every dbt invocation.

The most important flag to set is the `project_dir` flag, which points Dagster at the directory of your dbt project. For a full list of configuration options, refer to the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_cli_resource" /> API docs.

You can configure this resource and add it to your dbt assets by doing the following:

```python startafter=start_dbt_cli_resource endbefore=end_dbt_cli_resource file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource, load_assets_from_dbt_project

from dagster import with_resources

DBT_PROJECT_PATH = "path/to/dbt_project"

dbt_assets = with_resources(
    load_assets_from_dbt_project(DBT_PROJECT_PATH),
    {
        "dbt": dbt_cli_resource.configured(
            {"project_dir": DBT_PROJECT_PATH},
        )
    },
)
```

## Scheduling dbt jobs

Once you have your dbt assets, you can define a job that runs some or all of these assets on a schedule:

```python startafter=start_schedule_assets endbefore=end_schedule_assets file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster import ScheduleDefinition, define_asset_job, repository

run_everything_job = define_asset_job("run_everything", selection="*")

# only my_model and its children
run_something_job = define_asset_job("run_something", selection="my_model*")

@repository
def my_repo():
    return [
        dbt_assets,
        ScheduleDefinition(
            job=run_something_job,
            cron_schedule="@daily",
        ),
        ScheduleDefinition(
            job=run_everything_job,
            cron_schedule="@weekly",
        ),
    ]
```

Refer to the [Schedule documentation](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules#running-the-scheduler) for more info on running jobs on a schedule.

## Understanding asset keys

In Dagster, each asset has an asset key to identify it. Dagster automatically generates these keys for each dbt node in the project as well as the sources for each node.

- [Default asset keys for dbt models, seeds, and snapshots](#for-dbt-models-seeds-and-snapshots)
- [Default asset keys for dbt sources](#for-dbt-sources)
- [Adding a prefix to asset keys](#adding-a-prefix-to-asset-keys)

### For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots

For models, seeds, and snapshots, the default asset key will be the configured schema for that node (if any), concatenated with the name of the node.

For example, if you have configured a [custom schema](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas) for a subdirectory in your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yaml
models:
  my_project:
    marketing:
      +schema: marketing
```

Then the asset key for a model named `some_model` will be `marketing/some_model`. If you have not configured a custom schema, then the asset key will simply be `some_model`.

### For dbt sources

For sources, the default asset key will be the name of the source concatenated with the name of the source table.

For example, the source table defined in the following `sources.yaml` will be `jaffle_shop/orders`:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders
```

### Adding a prefix to asset keys

A common pattern is to use the prefix of an asset key to indicate what database an asset is stored in. For example, you might want all of your assets stored in Snowflake to start with the prefix `snowflake`.

To add a prefix to the models generated by your dbt project, you can pass in a `key_prefix` argument to either the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_manifest" /> or <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> function:

```python startafter=start_key_prefix endbefore=end_key_prefix file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_project(
    "path/to/dbt_project",
    key_prefix="snowflake",
)
```

**Note**: The `key_prefix` argument only applies to models. If you want to apply a prefix to the source keys that Dagster generates, pass in a `source_key_prefix` argument:

```python startafter=start_source_key_prefix endbefore=end_source_key_prefix file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_project(
    "path/to/dbt_project",
    source_key_prefix="snowflake",
)
```

## Defining dependencies

- [Upstream dependencies](#upstream-dependencies)
- [Downstream dependencies](#downstream-dependencies)

### Upstream dependencies

<Note>
  Check out{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two">
    part two of the dbt + Dagster tutorial
  </a>{" "}
  to see this concept in context.
</Note>

Dagster parses information about assets that are upstream of specific dbt models from the dbt project itself. Whenever a model is downstream of a [dbt source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources), that source will be parsed as an upstream asset.

For example, if you a source defined in your `sources.yml` file like this:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders
```

and use it in a model:

```sql
select * from {{source("jaffle_shop", "orders")}}
where foo=1
```

Then the asset created for that model will be given an upstream asset key of `jaffle_shop/orders`. In many cases, this upstream asset might also be managed by Dagster. If you add an asset definition to your repository which produces `jaffle_shop/orders`, then this asset will be upstream of your dbt model.

```python startafter=start_upstream_asset endbefore=end_upstream_asset file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
@asset(key_prefix="jaffle_shop")
def orders():
    return ...
```

### Downstream dependencies

<Note>
  Check out{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-four">
    part four of the dbt + Dagster tutorial
  </a>{" "}
  to see this concept in context.
</Note>

Dagster allows you to define assets that are downstream of specific dbt models. One property of dbt-based assets is that the external tool - in this case, dbt - handles storing each model in the database internally, rather than Dagster directly storing the tables that are updated.

This means that there's a range of ways to load a dbt model as input to a Python function. For example, you might want to load the contents as a Pandas dataframe or into a PySpark session. You can specify this loading behavior on each downstream asset.

For example, if you wanted to consume a dbt model with the asset key `my_dbt_model` as a Pandas dataframe, that would look something like the following:

```python startafter=start_downstream_asset endbefore=end_downstream_asset file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
@asset(
    ins={"my_dbt_model": AssetIn(input_manager_key="pandas_df_manager")},
)
def my_downstream_asset(my_dbt_model):
    # my_dbt_model is a Pandas dataframe
    return my_dbt_model.where(foo="bar")
```

#### Defining an I/O manager

<TODO></TODO>

- Add explanation for why this is required for downstream dependencies

The implementation of your I/O manager depends on:

- The Python object you want to use to represent your table, and
- The database that dbt is writing tables to

A simple I/O manager implementation that loads data from a dbt-managed table into a Pandas dataframe would look something like the following:

```python startafter=start_input_manager endbefore=end_input_manager file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
import pandas as pd

from dagster import IOManager, io_manager

class PandasIOManager(IOManager):
    def __init__(self, con_string: str):
        self._con = con_string

    def handle_output(self, context, obj):
        # dbt handles outputs for us
        pass

    def load_input(self, context) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """Load the contents of a table as a pandas DataFrame."""
        table_name = context.asset_key.path[-1]
        return pd.read_sql(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}", con=self._con)

@io_manager(config_schema={"con_string": str})
def pandas_io_manager(context):
    return PandasIOManager(context.resource_config["con_string"])
```

Once the I/O manager is defined, you can supply it like any other resource when calling <PyObject object="with_resources"/> :

```python startafter=start_input_manager_resources endbefore=end_input_manager_resources file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import dbt_cli_resource, load_assets_from_dbt_project

from dagster import with_resources

dbt_assets = with_resources(
    load_assets_from_dbt_project(...),
    {
        "dbt": dbt_cli_resource.configured(
            {"project_dir": "path/to/dbt_project"},
        ),
        "pandas_df_manager": pandas_io_manager.configured(
            {"con_string": "..."},
        ),
    },
)
```
