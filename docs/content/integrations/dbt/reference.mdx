## Scaffolding a Dagster project from a dbt project

<Note>
  Check out{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models">
    part two of the dbt & Dagster tutorial
  </a>{" "}
  to see this concept in context.
</Note>

You can create a Dagster project that wraps your dbt project by using the [`dagster-dbt project scaffold`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt#dagster-dbt-project-scaffold) command line interface.

```shell
dagster-dbt project scaffold --project-name project_dagster --dbt-project-dir path/to/dbt/project
```

This creates a directory called `project_dagster/` inside the current directory. The `project_dagster/` directory contains a set of files that define a Dagster project that loads the dbt project at the path defined by `--dbt-project-dir`. The path to the dbt project must contain a `dbt_project.yml`.

## Loading dbt models from a dbt project

<Note>
  Check out{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models">
    part two of the dbt & Dagster tutorial
  </a>{" "}
  to see this concept in context.
</Note>

The `dagster-dbt` library offers <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_assets" decorator /> to define Dagster assets for dbt models. It requires a [dbt manifest](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/artifacts/manifest-json), or `manifest.json`, to be created from your dbt project to parse your dbt project's representation.

The manifest can be created in two ways:

1. **At run time**: A dbt manifest is generated when your Dagster definitions are loaded, or
2. **At build time**: A dbt manifest is generated before loading your Dagster definitions and is included as part of your Python package.

When deploying your Dagster project to production, **we recommend generating the manifest at build time** to avoid the overhead of recompiling your dbt project every time your Dagster code is executed. A `manifest.json` should be precompiled and included in the Python package for your Dagster code.

The easiest way to handle the creation of your manifest file is to use <PyObject object="DbtProject" module="dagster_dbt" />.

In the Dagster project created by the [`dagster-dbt project scaffold`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt#dagster-dbt-project-scaffold) command, the creation of your manifest is handled at run time during development:

```python startafter=start_compile_dbt_manifest_with_dbt_project endbefore=end_compile_dbt_manifest_with_dbt_project file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path

from dagster_dbt import DbtProject

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(
    project_dir=Path(__file__).joinpath("..", "..", "..").resolve(),
    packaged_project_dir=Path(__file__)
    .joinpath("..", "..", "dbt-project")
    .resolve(),
)
my_dbt_project.prepare_if_dev()
```

The manifest path can then be accessed with `my_dbt_project.manifest_path`.

When developing locally, you can run the following command to generate the manifest at run time for your dbt and Dagster project:

```shell
dagster dev
```

In production, a precompiled manifest should be used. Using <PyObject object="DbtProject" module="dagster_dbt" />, the manifest can be created at build time by running the [`dagster-dbt project prepare-and-package`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt#dagster-dbt-project-prepare-and-package) command in your CI/CD workflow. For more information, see the [Deploying a Dagster project with a dbt project](#deploying-a-dagster-project-with-a-dbt-project) section.

## Deploying a Dagster project with a dbt project

<Note>
  <strong>Got questions about our recommendations or something to add?</strong>{" "}
  Join our{" "}
  <a href="https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/discussions/13767">
    GitHub discussion
  </a>{" "}
  to share how you deploy your Dagster code with your dbt project.
</Note>

When deploying your Dagster project to production, your dbt project must be present alongside your Dagster project so that dbt commands can be executed. As a result, we recommend that you set up your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows to package the dbt project with your Dagster project.

### Deploying a dbt project from a separate git repository

If you are managing your Dagster project in a separate git repository from your dbt project, you should include the following steps in your CI/CD workflows.

In your CI/CD workflows for your Dagster project:

1. Include any secrets that are required by your dbt project in your CI/CD environment.
2. Clone the dbt project repository as a subdirectory of your Dagster project.
3. Run `dagster-dbt project prepare-and-package --file path/to/project.py` to
   - Build your dbt project's dependencies,
   - Create a dbt manifest for your Dagster project, and
   - Package your dbt project

In the CI/CD workflows for your dbt project, set up a dispatch action to trigger a deployment of your Dagster project when your dbt project changes.

### Deploying a dbt project from a monorepo

<Note>
  With <a href="https://dagster.io/cloud">Dagster+</a>, we streamline this
  option. As part of our Dagster+ onboarding for dbt users, we can automatically
  create a Dagster project in an existing dbt project repository.
</Note>

If you are managing your Dagster project in the same git repository as your dbt project, you should include the following steps in your CI/CD workflows.

In your CI/CD workflows for your Dagster and dbt project:

1. Include any secrets that are required by your dbt project in your CI/CD environment.
2. Run `dagster-dbt project prepare-and-package --file path/to/project.py` to
   - Build your dbt project's dependencies,
   - Create a dbt manifest for your Dagster project, and
   - Package your dbt project

## Leveraging dbt defer with branch deployments

It is possible to leverage [dbt defer](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/defer) by passing a `state_path` to <PyObject object="DbtProject" module="dagster_dbt" />. This allows you to run a subset of models or tests based on the changes made since the state passed to `state_path`.

In practice, this is most useful when combined with branch deployments in Dagster, to test changes made in your branches. This can be easily done by updating your Dagster code and CI/CD file for branch deployments.

First, update your Dagster code to pass a `state_path` to your `DbtProject` object. Also, update the dbt command in your `@dbt_assets` definition to pass the defer args using `get_defer_args`.

```python startafter=start_use_dbt_defer_with_dbt_project endbefore=end_use_dbt_defer_with_dbt_project file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
import os
from pathlib import Path

from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(
    project_dir=Path(__file__).joinpath("..", "..", "..").resolve(),
    packaged_project_dir=(
        Path(__file__)
        .joinpath("..", "..", "dbt-project")
        .resolve()
    ),
    state_path=os.getenv("DBT_STATE_PATH"),
)
my_dbt_project.prepare_if_dev()

@dbt_assets(manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path)
def my_dbt_assets(
    context: AssetExecutionContext,
    dbt: DbtCliResource,
):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build", *dbt.get_defer_args()], context=context).stream()
```

In the code above, notice that the `state_path` is set using the `DBT_STATE_PATH` environment variable. This allows to pass a value to `state_path` only when needed - in our case, the `DBT_STATE_PATH` environment variable should be set only in a branch deployment context.

To do so, we need to update the `.github/workflows/branch_deployments.yml` file to set a value to the `DBT_STATE_PATH` environment variable. This will ensure that dbt uses a state path only as part of our Dagster+ branch deployments.

Open the file, scroll to the environment variable section, and set an environment variable named `DBT_STATE_PATH` to the path where your state artifacts are located. This should be on or around line 12:

```bash
env:
  DAGSTER_CLOUD_URL: ${{ secrets.DAGSTER_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION }}
  DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN }}
  ENABLE_FAST_DEPLOYS: 'true'
  PYTHON_VERSION: '3.8'
  DAGSTER_CLOUD_FILE: 'dagster_cloud.yaml'
  DBT_STATE_PATH: 'path/to/artifacts'
```

Save and commit the file to git. Don’t forget to push to remote!

## Using config with `@dbt_assets`

Like for a standard \[software-defined asset], `@dbt_assets` can use a config system to enable [run configuration](/concepts/configuration/config-schema). This allows to provide parameters to jobs at the time they're executed.

In the context of dbt, this can be useful if you want to run commands or flags for specific use cases. For instance, you may want to add [the --full-refresh flag](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/full_refresh) to your dbt commands in some cases. Using a config system, the `@dbt_assets` object can be easily modified to support this use case.

```python startafter=start_config_dbt_assets endbefore=end_config_dbt_assets file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path

from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, Config
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class MyDbtConfig(Config):
    full_refresh: bool

@dbt_assets(manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path)
def my_dbt_assets(
    context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource, config: MyDbtConfig
):
    dbt_build_args = ["build"]
    if config.full_refresh:
        dbt_build_args += ["--full-refresh"]

    yield from dbt.cli(dbt_build_args, context=context).stream()
```

Now that the `@dbt_assets` object is updated, the run configuration can be passed to a job.

```python startafter=start_config_dbt_job endbefore=end_config_dbt_job file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster import RunConfig, define_asset_job
from dagster_dbt import build_dbt_asset_selection

my_job = define_asset_job(
    name="all_dbt_assets",
    selection=build_dbt_asset_selection(
        [my_dbt_assets],
    ),
    config=RunConfig(
        ops={"my_dbt_assets": MyDbtConfig(full_refresh=True, seed=True)}
    ),
)
```

In the example above, the job is configured to use the `--full-refresh` flag with the dbt build command when materializing the assets.

---

## Scheduling dbt jobs

Once you have your dbt assets, you can define a job to materialize a selection of these assets on a schedule.

### Scheduling jobs that contain only dbt assets

In this example, we use the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="build_schedule_from_dbt_selection" /> function to create a job, `daily_dbt_models`, as well as a schedule which will execute this job once a day. We define the set of models we'd like to execute using [dbt's selection syntax](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax#how-does-selection-work), in this case selecting only the models with the tag `daily`.

```python startafter=start_schedule_assets_dbt_only endbefore=end_schedule_assets_dbt_only file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import build_schedule_from_dbt_selection, dbt_assets

@dbt_assets(manifest=manifest)
def my_dbt_assets(): ...

daily_dbt_assets_schedule = build_schedule_from_dbt_selection(
    [my_dbt_assets],
    job_name="daily_dbt_models",
    cron_schedule="@daily",
    dbt_select="tag:daily",
    # If your definition of `@dbt_assets` has Dagster Configuration, you can specify it here.
    # config=RunConfig(ops={"my_dbt_assets": MyDbtConfig(full_refresh=True)}),
)
```

### Scheduling jobs that contain dbt assets and non-dbt assets

In many cases, it's useful to be able to schedule dbt assets alongside non-dbt assets. In this example, we build an <PyObject module="dagster" object="AssetSelection" /> of dbt assets using <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="build_dbt_asset_selection" />, then select all assets (dbt-related or not) which are downstream of these dbt models. From there, we create a job that targets that selection of assets and schedule it to run daily.

```python startafter=start_schedule_assets_dbt_downstream endbefore=end_schedule_assets_dbt_downstream file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster import define_asset_job, ScheduleDefinition
from dagster_dbt import build_dbt_asset_selection, dbt_assets

@dbt_assets(manifest=manifest)
def my_dbt_assets(): ...

# selects all models tagged with "daily", and all their downstream asset dependencies
daily_selection = build_dbt_asset_selection(
    [my_dbt_assets], dbt_select="tag:daily"
).downstream()

daily_dbt_assets_and_downstream_schedule = ScheduleDefinition(
    job=define_asset_job("daily_assets", selection=daily_selection),
    cron_schedule="@daily",
)
```

Refer to the [Schedule documentation](/concepts/automation/schedules) for more info on running jobs on a schedule.

## Understanding asset definition attributes

In Dagster, each asset definition has attributes. Dagster automatically generates these attributes for each asset definition loaded from the dbt project. These attributes can optionally be overridden by the user.

- [Customizing asset keys](#customizing-asset-keys)
- [Customizing group names](#customizing-group-names)
- [Customizing owners](#customizing-owners)
- [Customizing descriptions](#customizing-descriptions)
- [Customizing metadata](#customizing-metadata)
- [Customizing tags](#customizing-tags)
- [Customizing automation conditions](#customizing-automation-conditions)

### Customizing asset keys

For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots, the default asset key will be the configured schema for that node, concatenated with the name of the node.

| dbt node type         | Schema    | Model name   | Resulting asset key |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| model, seed, snapshot | `None`    | `MODEL_NAME` | `MODEL_NAME`        |
|                       | `SCHEMA`  | `MODEL_NAME` | `SCHEMA/MODEL_NAME` |
|                       | `None`    | my_model     | some_model          |
|                       | marketing | my_model     | marketing/my_model  |

For dbt sources, the default asset key will be the name of the source concatenated with the name of the source table.

| dbt node type | Source name   | Table name   | Resulting asset key      |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------ |
| source        | `SOURCE_NAME` | `TABLE_NAME` | `SOURCE_NAME/TABLE_NAME` |
|               | jaffle_shop   | orders       | jaffle_shop/orders       |

There are two ways to customize the asset keys generated by Dagster for dbt assets:

1. Defining [meta config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) on your dbt node, or
2. Overriding Dagster's asset key generation by implementing a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" />.

To override an asset key generated by Dagster for a dbt node, you can define a `meta` key on your dbt node's `.yml` file. The following example overrides the asset key for a source and table as `snowflake/jaffle_shop/orders`:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders
        meta:
          dagster:
            asset_key: ["snowflake", "jaffle_shop", "orders"]
```

Alternatively, to override the asset key generation for all dbt nodes in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_asset_key"/>. The following example adds a `snowflake` prefix to the default generated asset key:

```python startafter=start_custom_asset_key_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_asset_key_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetKey, AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_asset_key(self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]) -> AssetKey:
        return super().get_asset_key(dbt_resource_props).with_prefix("snowflake")

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

### Customizing group names

For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots, the default Dagster group name will be the [dbt group](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/groups) defined for that node.

| dbt node type         | dbt group name | Resulting Dagster group name |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| model, seed, snapshot | `GROUP_NAME`   | `GROUP_NAME`                 |
|                       | `None`         | `None`                       |
|                       | finance        | finance                      |

There are two ways to customize the group names generated by Dagster for dbt assets:

1. Defining [meta config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) on your dbt node, or
2. Overriding Dagster's group name generation by implementing a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" />

To override the group name generated by Dagster for a dbt node, you can define a `meta` key in your dbt project file, on your dbt node's property file, or on the node's in-file config block. The following example overrides the Dagster group name for the following model as `marketing`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    config:
      meta:
        dagster:
          group: marketing
```

Alternatively, to override the Dagster group name generation for all dbt nodes in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_group_name"/>. The following example defines `snowflake` as the group name for all dbt nodes:

```python startafter=start_custom_group_name_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_group_name_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping, Optional

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_group_name(
        self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]
    ) -> Optional[str]:
        return "snowflake"

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

### Customizing owners

For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots, the default Dagster owner will be the email associated with the [dbt group](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/groups) defined for that node.

| dbt node type         | dbt group name | dbt group's email   | Resulting Dagster owner |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| model, seed, snapshot | `GROUP_NAME`   | `OWNER@DOMAIN.COM`  | `OWNER@DOMAIN.COM`      |
|                       | `GROUP_NAME`   | `None`              | `None`                  |
|                       | `None`         | `None`              | `None`                  |
|                       | finance        | `owner@company.com` | `owner@company.com`     |
|                       | finance        | `None`              | `None`                  |

There are two ways to customize the asset keys generated by Dagster for dbt assets:

1. Defining [meta config](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta) on your dbt node, or
2. Overriding Dagster's generation of owners by implementing a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" />

To override the owners generated by Dagster for a dbt node, you can define a `meta` key in your dbt project file, on your dbt node's property file, or on the node's in-file config block. The following example overrides the Dagster owners for the following model as `owner@company.com` and `team:data@company.com`:

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    config:
      meta:
        dagster:
          owners: ["owner@company.com", "team:data@company.com"]
```

Alternatively, to override the Dagster generation of owners for all dbt nodes in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_group_name"/>. The following example defines `owner@company.com` and `team:data@company.com` as the owners for all dbt nodes:

```python startafter=start_custom_owners_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_owners_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping, Optional, Sequence

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_owners(
        self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]
    ) -> Optional[Sequence[str]]:
        return ["owner@company.com", "team:data@company.com"]

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

### Customizing descriptions

For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots, the default Dagster description will be the dbt node's description.

To override the Dagster description for all dbt nodes in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_description"/>. The following example defines the raw SQL of the dbt node as the Dagster description:

```python startafter=start_custom_description_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_description_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
import textwrap
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_description(self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]) -> str:
        return textwrap.indent(dbt_resource_props.get("raw_sql", ""), "\t")

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

### Customizing metadata

For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots, the default Dagster definition metadata will be the dbt node's declared column schema.

To override the Dagster definition metadata for all dbt nodes in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_metadata"/>. The following example defines the metadata of the dbt node as the Dagster metadata, using <PyObject module="dagster" object="MetadataValue"/>:

```python startafter=start_custom_metadata_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_metadata_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import MetadataValue, AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_metadata(
        self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]
    ) -> Mapping[str, Any]:
        return {
            "dbt_metadata": MetadataValue.json(dbt_resource_props.get("meta", {}))
        }

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

Dagster also supports fetching additional metadata at dbt execution time to attach to asset materializations. For more information, see the [Customizing asset materialization metadata](#customizing-asset-materialization-metadata) section.

#### Attaching code reference metadata

Dagster's dbt integration can automatically attach [code reference](/guides/dagster/code-references) metadata to the SQL files backing your dbt assets. To enable this feature, set the `enable_code_references` parameter to `True` in the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslatorSettings" /> passed to your <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" />:

```python file=/guides/dagster/code_references/with_dbt_code_references.py
from pathlib import Path

from dagster_dbt import (
    DagsterDbtTranslator,
    DagsterDbtTranslatorSettings,
    DbtCliResource,
    DbtProject,
    dbt_assets,
)

from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, Definitions, with_source_code_references

my_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

# links to dbt model source code from assets
dagster_dbt_translator = DagsterDbtTranslator(
    settings=DagsterDbtTranslatorSettings(enable_code_references=True)
)


@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=dagster_dbt_translator,
    project=my_project,
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()


defs = Definitions(assets=with_source_code_references([my_dbt_assets]))
```

### Customizing tags

<Note>
  In Dagster, tags are key-value pairs. However, in dbt, tags are strings. To
  bridge this divide, the dbt tag string is used as the Dagster tag key, and the
  Dagster tag value is set to the empty string,
  <code>""</code>. Any dbt tags that don't match Dagster's supported tag key format
  (e.g. they contain unsupported characters) will be ignored by default.
</Note>

For dbt models, seeds, and snapshots, the default Dagster tags will be the dbt node's configured tags.

Any dbt tags that don't match Dagster's supported tag key format (e.g. they contain unsupported characters) will be ignored.

To override the Dagster tags for all dbt nodes in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_tags"/>. The following converts dbt tags of the form `foo=bar` to key/value pairs:

```python startafter=start_custom_tags_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_tags_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_tags(self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]) -> Mapping[str, str]:
        dbt_tags = dbt_resource_props.get("tags", [])
        dagster_tags = {}
        for tag in dbt_tags:
            key, _, value = tag.partition("=")

            dagster_tags[key] = value if value else ""

        return dagster_tags

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

### Customizing automation conditions

To override the <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" /> generated for each dbt node in your dbt project, you can create a custom <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> and implement <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" method="get_automation_condition"/>. The following example defines <PyObject object="AutomationCondition" method="eager" /> as the condition for all dbt nodes:

```python startafter=start_custom_automation_condition_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_custom_automation_condition_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext, AutomationCondition
from dagster_dbt import DagsterDbtTranslator, DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets
from typing import Any, Mapping, Optional

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

class CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(DagsterDbtTranslator):
    def get_automation_condition(
        self, dbt_resource_props: Mapping[str, Any]
    ) -> Optional[AutomationCondition]:
        return AutomationCondition.eager()

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=CustomDagsterDbtTranslator(),
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

\--

## dbt models, code versions, and "Unsynced"

Note that Dagster allows the optional specification of a [`code_version`](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#asset-code-versions) for each asset definition, which are used to track changes. The `code_version` for an asset arising from a dbt model is defined automatically as the hash of the SQL defining the DBT model. This allows the asset graph in the UI to use the "Unsynced" status to indicate which dbt models have new SQL since they were last materialized.

---

## Loading dbt tests as asset checks

<Note>
  <strong>Asset checks for dbt have been enabled by default, starting in `dagster-dbt` 0.23.0.</strong><br/>
  `dbt-core` 1.6 or later is required for full functionality.

</Note>

Dagster loads your dbt tests as [asset checks](/concepts/assets/asset-checks).

### Indirect selection

Dagster uses [dbt indirect selection](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/global-configs/indirect-selection) to select dbt tests. By default, Dagster won't set `DBT_INDIRECT_SELECTION` so that the set of tests selected by Dagster is the same as the selected by dbt. When required, Dagster will override `DBT_INDIRECT_SELECTION` to `empty` in order to explicitly select dbt tests. For example:

- Materializing dbt assets and excluding their asset checks
- Executing dbt asset checks without materializing their assets

### Singular tests

Dagster will load both generic and singular tests as asset checks. In the event that your singular test depends on multiple dbt models, you can use dbt metadata to specify which Dagster asset it should target. These fields can be filled in as they would be for the dbt [ref function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref). The configuration can be supplied in a [config block](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/data-test-configs) for the singular test.

```sql
{{
    config(
        meta={
            'dagster': {
                'ref': {
                    'name': 'customers',
                    'package_name': 'my_dbt_assets'
                    'version': 1,
                },
            }
        }
    )
}}
```

`dbt-core` version 1.6 or later is required for Dagster to read this metadata.

If this metadata isn't provided, Dagster won't ingest the test as an asset check. It will still run the test and emit a <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> events with the test results.

### Disabling asset checks

You can disable modeling your dbt tests as asset checks. The tests will still run and will be emitted as <PyObject object="AssetObservation"/> events. To do so you'll need to define a <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslator" /> with <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DagsterDbtTranslatorSettings" /> that have asset checks disabled. The following example disables asset checks when using <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_assets" decorator/>:

```python startafter=start_disable_asset_check_dagster_dbt_translator endbefore=end_disable_asset_check_dagster_dbt_translator file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import (
    DagsterDbtTranslator,
    DagsterDbtTranslatorSettings,
    DbtCliResource,
    DbtProject,
    dbt_assets,
)

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))
dagster_dbt_translator = DagsterDbtTranslator(
    settings=DagsterDbtTranslatorSettings(enable_asset_checks=False)
)

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    dagster_dbt_translator=dagster_dbt_translator,
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream()
```

---

## Customizing asset materialization metadata

Dagster supports fetching additional metadata at dbt execution time to attach as [materialization metadata](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata), which is recorded each time your models are rebuilt and displayed in the Dagster UI.

### Fetching row count data

<Note>
  <strong>
    Emitting row count data for dbt models is currently an experimental feature.
  </strong>{" "}
  To use this feature, you'll need to be on at least{" "}
  <code>dagster>=0.17.6</code> and
  <code>dagster-dbt>=0.23.6</code>.
</Note>

Dagster can automatically fetch [row counts](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata/table-metadata#attaching-row-count) for dbt-generated tables and emit them as [materialization metadata](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata) to be displayed in the Dagster UI.

Row counts are fetched in parallel to the execution of your dbt models. To enable this feature, call <PyObject object="fetch_row_counts" module="dagster_dbt.core.dbt_cli_invocation.DbtEventIterator" displayText="fetch_row_counts()" /> on the <PyObject object="DbtEventIterator" module="dagster_dbt.core.dbt_cli_invocation" /> returned by the `stream()` dbt CLI call:

```python startafter=start_fetch_row_count endbefore=end_fetch_row_count file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtProject, DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream().fetch_row_counts()
```

Once your dbt models have been materialized, you can view the row count data in the metadata table.

### Fetching column-level metadata

<Note>
  <strong>
    Emitting column-level metadata for dbt models is currently an experimental
    feature.
  </strong>{" "}
  To use this feature, you'll need to be on at least <code>dagster>=1.8.0</code>{" "}
  and
  <code>dagster-dbt>=0.24.0</code>.
</Note>

Dagster allows you to emit column-level metadata, like [column schema](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata/table-metadata#attaching-column-schema) and [column lineage](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata/column-level-lineage), as [materialization metadata](/concepts/metadata-tags/asset-metadata).

With this metadata, you can view documentation in Dagster for all columns, not just columns described in your dbt project.

Column-level metadata is fetched in parallel to the execution of your dbt models. To enable this feature, call <PyObject object="fetch_column_metadata" module="dagster_dbt.core.dbt_cli_invocation.DbtEventIterator" displayText="fetch_column_metadata()" /> on the <PyObject object="DbtEventIterator" module="dagster_dbt.core.dbt_cli_invocation" /> returned by the `stream()` dbt CLI call:

```python startafter=start_fetch_column_metadata endbefore=end_fetch_column_metadata file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtProject, DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from (
        dbt.cli(["build"], context=context).stream().fetch_column_metadata()
    )
```

### Composing metadata fetching methods

Metadata fetching methods such as <PyObject object="fetch_column_metadata" module="dagster_dbt.core.dbt_cli_invocation.DbtEventIterator" displayText="fetch_column_metadata()" /> can be chained with other metadata fetching methods like <PyObject object="fetch_row_counts" module="dagster_dbt.core.dbt_cli_invocation.DbtEventIterator" displayText="fetch_row_counts()" />:

```python startafter=start_fetch_column_metadata_chain endbefore=end_fetch_column_metadata_chain file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from pathlib import Path
from dagster import AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtProject, DbtCliResource, dbt_assets

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    yield from (
        dbt.cli(["build"], context=context)
        .stream()
        .fetch_row_counts()
        .fetch_column_metadata()
    )
```

## Defining dependencies

- [Upstream dependencies](#upstream-dependencies)
- [Downstream dependencies](#downstream-dependencies)

### Upstream dependencies

#### Defining an asset as an upstream dependency of a dbt model

Dagster allows you to define existing assets as upstream dependencies of dbt models. For example, say you have the following asset with asset key `upstream`:

```python startafter=start_upstream_dagster_asset endbefore=end_upstream_dagster_asset file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster import asset

@asset
def upstream(): ...
```

In order to define this asset as an upstream dependency for a dbt model, you'll need to first declare it as a [data source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources#declaring-a-source) in the `sources.yml` file. Here, you can explicitly provide your asset key to a source table:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: dagster
    tables:
      - name: upstream
        meta:
          dagster:
            asset_key: ["upstream"]
```

Then, in the downstream model, you can select from this source data. This defines a dependency relationship between your upstream asset and dbt model:

```sql
select *
  from {{ source("dagster", "upstream") }}
 where foo=1
```

#### Defining a dbt source as a Dagster asset

Dagster parses information about assets that are upstream of specific dbt models from the dbt project itself. Whenever a model is downstream of a [dbt source](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources), that source will be parsed as an upstream asset.

For example, if you defined a source in your `sources.yml` file like this:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders
```

and use it in a model:

```sql
select *
  from {{ source("jaffle_shop", "orders") }}
 where foo=1
```

Then this model has an upstream source with the `jaffle_shop/orders` asset key.

In order to manage this upstream asset with Dagster, you can define it by passing the key into an asset definition via <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="get_asset_key_for_source"/>:

```python startafter=start_upstream_asset endbefore=end_upstream_asset file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster import asset, AssetExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, get_asset_key_for_source, dbt_assets

@dbt_assets(manifest=MANIFEST_PATH)
def my_dbt_assets(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource): ...

@asset(key=get_asset_key_for_source([my_dbt_assets], "jaffle_shop"))
def orders():
    return ...
```

This allows you to change asset keys within your dbt project without having to update the corresponding Dagster definitions.

The <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="get_asset_key_for_source" /> method is used when a source has only one table. However, if a source contains multiple tables, like this example:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: clients_data
    tables:
      - name: names
      - name: history
```

You can use define a <PyObject object="multi_asset" decorator/> with keys from <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="get_asset_keys_by_output_name_for_source"/> instead:

```python startafter=start_upstream_multi_asset endbefore=end_upstream_multi_asset file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster import multi_asset, AssetOut, Output
from dagster_dbt import get_asset_keys_by_output_name_for_source

@multi_asset(
    outs={
        name: AssetOut(key=asset_key)
        for name, asset_key in get_asset_keys_by_output_name_for_source(
            [my_dbt_assets], "jaffle_shop"
        ).items()
    }
)
def jaffle_shop(context: AssetExecutionContext):
    output_names = list(context.op_execution_context.selected_output_names)
    yield Output(value=..., output_name=output_names[0])
    yield Output(value=..., output_name=output_names[1])
```

### Downstream dependencies

Dagster allows you to define assets that are downstream of specific dbt models via <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="get_asset_key_for_model"/>. The below example defines `my_downstream_asset` as a downstream dependency of `my_dbt_model`:

```python startafter=start_downstream_asset endbefore=end_downstream_asset file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import get_asset_key_for_model
from dagster import asset

@asset(deps=[get_asset_key_for_model([my_dbt_assets], "my_dbt_model")])
def my_downstream_asset(): ...
```

In the downstream asset, you may want direct access to the contents of the dbt model. To do so, you can customize the code within your `@asset`-decorated function to load upstream data.

Dagster alternatively allows you to delegate loading data to an I/O manager. For example, if you wanted to consume a dbt model with the asset key `my_dbt_model` as a Pandas dataframe, that would look something like the following:

```python startafter=start_downstream_asset_pandas_df_manager endbefore=end_downstream_asset_pandas_df_manager file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
from dagster_dbt import get_asset_key_for_model
from dagster import AssetIn, asset

@asset(
    ins={
        "my_dbt_model": AssetIn(
            input_manager_key="pandas_df_manager",
            key=get_asset_key_for_model([my_dbt_assets], "my_dbt_model"),
        )
    },
)
def my_downstream_asset(my_dbt_model):
    # my_dbt_model is a Pandas dataframe
    return my_dbt_model.where(foo="bar")
```

## Building incremental models using partitions

You can define a Dagster <PyObject module="dagster" object="PartitionDefinition"/> alongside dbt in order to build incremental models.

Partitioned assets will be able to access the <PyObject module="dagster" object="TimeWindow"/>'s start and end dates, and these can be passed to dbt's CLI as variables which can be used to filter incremental models.

When a partition definition to passed to the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_assets" decorator/> decorator, all assets are defined to operate on the same partitions. With this in mind, we can retrieve any time window from <PyObject module="dagster"  object="AssetExecutionContext" method="partition_time_window"/> property in order to get the current start and end partitions.

```python startafter=start_build_incremental_model endbefore=end_build_incremental_model file=/integrations/dbt/dbt.py dedent=4
import json
from pathlib import Path

from dagster import DailyPartitionsDefinition, OpExecutionContext
from dagster_dbt import DbtCliResource, DbtProject, dbt_assets

my_dbt_project = DbtProject(project_dir=Path("path/to/dbt_project"))

@dbt_assets(
    manifest=my_dbt_project.manifest_path,
    partitions_def=DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date="2023-01-01"),
)
def partitionshop_dbt_assets(context: OpExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    start, end = context.partition_time_window

    dbt_vars = {"min_date": start.isoformat(), "max_date": end.isoformat()}
    dbt_build_args = ["build", "--vars", json.dumps(dbt_vars)]

    yield from dbt.cli(dbt_build_args, context=context).stream()
```

With the variables defined, we can now reference `min_date` and `max_date` in our SQL and configure the dbt model as incremental. Here, we define an incremental run to operate on rows with `order_date` that is between our `min_date` and `max_date`.

```sql
-- Configure the model as incremental, use a unique_key and the delete+insert strategy to ensure the pipeline is idempotent.
{{ config(materialized='incremental', unique_key='order_date', incremental_strategy="delete+insert") }}

select * from {{ ref('my_model') }}

-- Use the Dagster partition variables to filter rows on an incremental run
{% if is_incremental() %}
where order_date >= '{{ var('min_date') }}' and order_date <= '{{ var('max_date') }}'
{% endif %}
```
