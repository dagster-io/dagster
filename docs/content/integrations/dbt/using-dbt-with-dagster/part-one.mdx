# Using dbt with Dagster, part one: Set up the dbt project

<Note>
  This is part one of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">
    Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets
  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

First, you'll download Dagster's `tutorial_dbt_dagster` example and configure the dbt project it contains. The example uses dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), but you can follow along with a different project as well.

In this part, you'll:

- [Download the `tutorial_dbt_dagster` example](#step-1-download-the-tutorial_dbt_dagster-example)
- [Create a DuckDB connection profile](#step-2-create-a-duckdb-profile)
- [Configure dbt model data sources](#step-3-configure-dbt-model-data-sources)

---

## Step 1: Download the tutorial_dbt_dagster example

Let's get started by downloading the [`tutorial_dbt_dagster` example](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/tree/master/examples/tutorial_dbt_dagster).

1. In the terminal, run the following to download the example:

   ```shell
   dagster project from-example --name tutorial_dbt_dagster --example tutorial_dbt_dagster
   ```

2. Navigate into the `tutorial_dbt_dagster` folder:

   ```shell
   cd tutorial_dbt_dagster
   ```

3. Run the following to install the project's dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Step 2: Create a DuckDB profile

In this step, you'll add a DuckDB profile to the dbt project. This will allow you to connect dbt to the DuckDB database.

1. Open the `profiles.yml` file, located in `/tutorial_template/jaffle_shop/config`.

2. Add the following code to the file:

   ```yaml
   jaffle_shop:
     target: local
     outputs:
       local:
         type: duckdb
         path: tutorial.duckdb
         schema: jaffle_shop
   ```

---

## Step 3: Configure dbt model data sources

Next, you'll tell the models in your dbt project where the source data they depend on will be located. There isn't any data yet - we'll create Dagster assets that fetch and provide data to the dbt models later in the tutorial.

In dbt, [sources are declared](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources#declaring-a-source) using `sources.yml` files. We've provided this file for you in `/tutorial_template/jaffle_shop/models`, which defines the location of tables containing source data:

```yaml
version: 2

sources:
  - name: jaffle_shop
    tables:
      - name: orders_raw
      - name: customers_raw
```

The Dagster assets you build in [part three of this tutorial](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three) will create `orders_raw` and `customers_raw` tables when materialized. To have the dbt models select data from these tables, you'll need to update the models in the project.

In `/tutorial_template/jaffle_shop/models/staging`, update the `stg_customers.sql` and `stg_orders.sql` models to use the [`{{ source()}}` function](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/source). This function tells the dbt model to select data from the defined source. In this example, that's the `customers_raw` and `orders_raw` tables in the DuckDB database:

1. In `stg_customers.sql`, replace its contents with the following:

   ```sql
   select
       id as customer_id,
       first_name,
       last_name
   from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'customers_raw') }}
   ```

2. In `stg_orders.sql`, replace its contents with the following:

   ```sql
   select
       id as order_id,
       user_id as customer_id,
       order_date,
       status
   from {{ source('jaffle_shop', 'orders_raw') }}
   ```

---

## What's next?

At this point, you should have a fully-configured dbt project that's ready to work with Dagster. The next step is to [load the dbt models into Dagster as assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two).
