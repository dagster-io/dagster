# Using dbt with Dagster, part one: Set up the dbt project

<Note>
  This is part one of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">Using dbt with Dagster</a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

The first part of this tutorial doesn't involve Dagster at all. You'll get a dbt project running on your computer.

In this part, you'll:

- [Download a dbt project](#step-1-download-the-sample-dbt-project)
- [Configure your dbt project to run with DuckDB](#step-2-configure-your-dbt-project-to-run-with-duckdb)
- [Build your dbt project](#step-3-build-your-dbt-project)

---

## Step 1: Download the sample dbt project

Let's get started by downloading a sample dbt project. We'll use the standard dbt [Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop) example.

1. First, create a folder that will ultimately contain both your dbt project and Dagster code.

   ```shell
   mkdir tutorial-dbt-dagster
   ```

2. Then, navigate into that folder:

   ```shell
   cd tutorial-dbt-dagster
   ```

3. Finally, download the sample dbt project into that folder.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop.git
   ```

---

## Step 2: Configure your dbt project to run with DuckDB

Running dbt requires a data warehouse to store the tables that are created from the dbt models. For our data warehouse, we'll use DuckDB, because setting it up doesn't require any long-running services or external infrastructure.

You'll set up dbt to work with DuckDB by configuring a dbt [profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/connection-profiles):

1. Navigate into the `jaffle_shop` folder, which was created when you downloaded the project, inside your `tutorial-dbt-dagster` folder:

   ```shell
   cd jaffle_shop
   ```

2. In this folder, with your text editor of choice, create a file named `profiles.yml` and add the following code to it:

   ```yaml
   jaffle_shop:
     target: dev
     outputs:
       dev:
         type: duckdb
         path: tutorial.duckdb
         threads: 24
   ```

---

## Step 3: Build your dbt project

With the profile configured above, your dbt project should now be usable. To test it out, run:

```shell
dbt build
```

This will run all the models, seeds, and snapshots in the project and store a set of tables in your DuckDB database.

---

## What's next?

At this point, you should have a fully-configured dbt project that's ready to work with Dagster. The next step is to [load the dbt models into Dagster as assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models).
