# Using dbt with Dagster, part four: Add a downstream asset

<Note>
  This is part four of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">
    Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets
  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

By this point, you've [set up a dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-one), [loaded dbt models into Dagster as assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-two), and [created and materialized upstream assets using Dagit](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three).

In this step, you'll:

- [Create a downstream asset that computes a chart using plotly](#step-1-create-the-order_count_chart-asset)
- [Materialize the `order_count_chart` asset](#step-2-materialize-the-order_count_chart-asset)

---

## Step 1: Create the order_count_chart asset

You've added upstream assets to your data pipeline, but nothing downstream - until now. In this step, you'll create a Dagster asset called `order_count_chart` that's downstream of the `customers` asset produced by the `stg_orders` and `stg_customers` dbt models. The `order_count_chart` asset computes a plotly chart using the data from its upstream asset dependency.

Here's a quick refresher of what our graph of assets currently looks like:

src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three-asset-graph-materialized.png"
width={1091}
height={896}
/>

To add the `order_count_chart` asset:

1. In `/tutorial_template/tutorial_dbt_dagster/assets/__init__.py`, replace the imports section with the following:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import plotly.express as px
   from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_project

   from dagster import AssetIn, MetadataValue, asset, file_relative_path
   ```

2. At the bottom of the file, add the following:

   ```python
   @asset(
       ins={"customers": AssetIn(key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"])},
       group_name="staging",
   )
   def order_count_chart(context, customers: pd.DataFrame):
       fig = px.histogram(customers, x="number_of_orders")
       fig.update_layout(bargap=0.2)
       save_chart_path = file_relative_path(__file__, "order_count_chart.html")
       fig.write_html(save_chart_path, auto_open=True)

       context.add_output_metadata({"plot_url": MetadataValue.url("file://" + save_chart_path)})
   ```

Let's review what's happening here:

- `customers` is supplied as an argument to `ins`, defining it as an upstream asset dependency of the `order_count_chart` asset

- We've also used <PyObject object="AssetIn" /> to explicitly define an upstream dependency. Just like in [part three of this tutorial](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-three#step-1-create-upstream-dagster-assets), we've defined these as `jaffle_shop` and `staging`, respectively.

- Finally, the chart is saved as `order_count_chart.html` in `/tutorial_template/tutorial_dbt_dagster` and automatically opened in the browser upon successful materialization.

At this point, `/tutorial_template/tutorial_dbt_dagster/assets/__init__.py` should look like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_project

from dagster import AssetIn, MetadataValue, asset, file_relative_path


@asset(key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"], group_name="staging")
def customers_raw() -> pd.DataFrame:
   data = pd.read_csv("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/customers.csv")
   return data


@asset(key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"], group_name="staging")
def orders_raw() -> pd.DataFrame:
   data = pd.read_csv("https://docs.dagster.io/assets/orders.csv")
   return data


DBT_PROJECT_PATH = file_relative_path(__file__, "../../jaffle_shop")
DBT_PROFILES = file_relative_path(__file__, "../../jaffle_shop/config")

dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_project(
    project_dir=DBT_PROJECT_PATH, profiles_dir=DBT_PROFILES, key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"]
)


@asset(
   ins={"customers": AssetIn(key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"])},
   group_name="staging",
)
def order_count_chart(context, customers: pd.DataFrame):
   fig = px.histogram(customers, x="number_of_orders")
   fig.update_layout(bargap=0.2)
   save_chart_path = file_relative_path(__file__, "order_count_chart.html")
   fig.write_html(save_chart_path, auto_open=True)

   context.add_output_metadata({"plot_url": MetadataValue.url("file://" + save_chart_path)})
```

---

## Step 2: Materialize the order_count_chart asset

In this step, you'll materialize the `order_count_chart_asset`. When successfully materialized, a new tab containing the plotly chart will automatically open in your browser.

1. Back in Dagit on the asset graph, click **Reload definitions**. This ensures that Dagit picks up the changes you made in the previous steps.

   At this point, the `order_count_chart` asset should display below `customers` as a downstream dependency:

   <Image
   alt="order_count_chart asset displaying in Dagit's asset graph"
   src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/part-four-new-asset.png"
   width={998}
   height={808}
   />

2. Click the `order_count_chart` asset to select it.

3. Click **Materialize selected** to kick off a run that materializes the asset.

That's it! When the run successfully completes, the following chart will automatically open in your browser:

<Image

/>
