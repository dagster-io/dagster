# Guide: Using dbt with Dagster+

This guide helps you getting started with dbt in Dagster+. Importing an existing dbt project in Dagster+ allows you to automatically load your dbt models as Dagster assets. This can be be done with an existing dbt project, that is not already using Dagster, or a Dagster project in which your dbt project is included.

## Import your dbt project to Dagster+

Using Dagster+ Serverless, importing a dbt project to create a new Dagster project and deploy your code location is as easy as it gets. After browsing to Deployment > Code Locations > Add code location, choosing the option "Import a dbt project" allows you to import the Git repo of your dbt project.

### Example: import a dbt project from a GitHub repo

[//]: <> "TODO: Add screenshot of Dagster+"

#### Select and deploy the repo

#### Review the state of the repo

When deploying a dbt project for the first time, the workflow uses the `dagster-dbt scaffold` command to create a Dagster project matching the dbt one. Once this process is completed, the workflow will open a pull request in your Git repository so that you can review the newly generated code and merge it to the production branch.

[//]: <> "TODO: Add example of the pull request?"

#### Understanding the file structure

[//]: <> "TODO: Add file structure as code and concrete example"
