# Snowflake & Dagster

Using Dagster's [asset definitions](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) and a Snowflake [resource](/concepts/resources) or [I/O manager](/concepts/io-management/io-managers), you can easily interact with Snowflake tables alongside other Dagster assets.

Managing your Snowflake tables with Dagster enables you to:

- Use Python to analyze your data stored in Snowflake without writing custom SQL queries to fetch the data
- Visualize the data dependencies between tables
- Selectively update the contents of your tables
- Integrate your Snowflake tables with other tools in your data stack

## Snowflake and Dagster tutorial

Dagster's Snowflake integration provides two ways of interacting with Snowflake tables:

- [**Resources**](/concepts/resources), which allow you to directly run SQL queries against tables within an asset's compute function
- [**I/O managers**](/concepts/io-management/io-managers), which transfer the responsibility of storing and loading DataFrames as Snowflake tables to Dagster

By the end of each guide, you will have a working connection to your Snowflake instance and assets that create tables in Snowflake or read from existing tables in Snowflake. Use the links below to get started!
