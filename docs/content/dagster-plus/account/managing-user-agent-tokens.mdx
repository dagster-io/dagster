3. Click the **Tokens** tab.

After the token is created:

- **To view a token**, click **Reveal token**. Clicking on the token value will copy it to the clipboard.
- **To edit a token's description**, click the **pencil icon**.

The permissions dialog allows you to edit a token's ability to access certain deployments. By default, agent tokens have permission to access any deployment in the organization including branch deployments. This is called **Org Agent** and is set using the toggle in the top right of the dialog. To edit individual deployment permissions, **Org Agent** has to first be toggled off.
