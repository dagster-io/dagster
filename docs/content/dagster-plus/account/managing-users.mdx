# Managing users in Dagster Cloud

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster Cloud.</Note>

In this guide, we'll cover how to add and remove users in your Dagster Cloud organization.

**Note**: If utilizing [SCIM provisioning](/dagster-cloud/account/authentication/utilizing-scim-provisioning), you'll need to manage users through your Identity Provider (IdP) instead of Dagster Cloud.

---

## Adding users

<Note>
  <strong>Organization Admin</strong> or <strong>Admin</strong> permissions are
  required to add users in Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

Before you start, note that:

- **If SCIM provisioning is enabled,** you'll need to add new users in your IdP. Adding users will be disabled in Dagster Cloud.
- **If using Google for SSO**, users must be added in Dagster Cloud before they can log in.
- **If using an Identity Provider (IdP) like Okta for SSO**, users must be assigned to the Dagster app in the IdP to be able to log in to Dagster Cloud. Refer to the [SSO setup guides](/dagster-cloud/account/authentication#single-sign-on) for setup instructions for each of our supported IdP solutions.

  By default, users will be granted Viewer permissions on each deployment. The default role can be adjusted by modifying the [`sso_default_role` deployment setting](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/deployment-settings-reference#sso-default-role).

1. Sign in to your Dagster Cloud account.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Organization Settings**.
3. Click the **Users** tab.
4. Click **Add new user.**
5. In the **User email** field, enter the user's email address.
6. Click **Add user**. The user will be added to the list of users.

After the user is created, you can [add the user to teams and assign user roles for each deployment](#managing-user-permissions).

## Managing user permissions

<Note>
  <strong>Organization Admin</strong> permissions are required to manage users
  in Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

After a user is created, the **Manage user permissions** window will automatically display. You can also access this window by clicking **Edit** next to a user in the users table.

### Adding users to teams

<Note>Teams are a Dagster Cloud Pro feature.</Note>

Using the **Teams** field, you can add users to one or more teams. This is useful for centralizing permission sets for different types of users. Refer to the [Managing teams](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-teams) guide for more info about creating and managing teams.

**Note**: When determining a user's level of access, Dagster Cloud will use the **most permissive** role assigned to the user between all of their team memberships and any individual role grants. Refer to the [Managing user roles and permissions](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions#applying-role-overrides) guide for more info.

### Assigning user roles

In the **Roles** section, you can assign the select the appropriate [user role](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions) for each deployment.

1. Next to a deployment, click **Edit user role**.
2. Select the user role for the deployment. This [user role](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions) will be used as the default for all code locations in the deployment.
3. Click **Save**.
4. **Pro only**: To set permissions for individual [code locations](/dagster-cloud/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions#code-locations) in a deployment:
   1. Click the toggle to the left of the deployment to open a list of code locations.
   2. Next to a code location, click **Edit user role**.
   3. Select the user role for the code location.
   4. Click **Save**.
5. Repeat the previous steps for each deployment.
6. **Optional**: To change the user's permissions for branch deployments:
   1. Next to **All branch deployments**, click **Edit user role**.
   2. Select the user role to use for all branch deployments.
   3. Click **Save**.
7. Click **Done**.

## Removing users

<Note>
  <strong>Organization Admin</strong> permissions are required to remove users
  in Dagster Cloud.
</Note>

Removing a user removes them from the organization. **Note**: If using a SAML-based SSO solution like Okta, you'll also need to remove the user from the IdP. Removing the user in Dagster Cloud doesn't remove them from the IdP.

1. Sign in to your Dagster Cloud account.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Organization Settings**.
3. Click the **Users** tab.
4. Locate the user in the user list.
5. Click **Edit**.
6. Click **Remove user**.
7. When prompted, confirm the removal.
