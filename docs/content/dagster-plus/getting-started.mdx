# Getting started with Dagster+

Welcome to Dagster+!

In this guide, we'll give you everything you need to get up and running with Dagster+, including:

- Creating your Dagster+ account
- Selecting a deployment type
- Deploying your code
- Setting up CI/CD
- Setting up environment variables and secrets

Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Create a Dagster+ account and organization

If you don't already have a Dagster+ account, [sign up for one](https://dagster.cloud/signup) before continuing.

You'll also be asked to create a Dagster+ organization. When your organization is created, a single deployment, named `prod`, will also be created. Refer to the [Managing deployments guide](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/managing-deployments) for more information about deployments in Dagster+.

---

## Step 2: Select a deployment type

In this step, you'll select the type of deployment you want to use: **Serverless** or **Hybrid**.

Select the deployment type you want to use and [proceed to the next step](#step-3-deploy-your-code). **Note**: If you find your deployment type isn't right for you, it can be changed at any time.

---

## Step 3: Deploy your code

Now that you've selected a deployment type, the next step is to tell Dagster+ the location of your Dagster code. In addition to this, you'll set up Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). Once completed, [Branch Deployments](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/branch-deployments) and continuous code location deployments will be enabled for your Dagster project.

The steps for accomplishing this vary depending on the **deployment type** you selected in the previous step:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Select deployment type">

Click the tab for your deployment type - [**Serverless**](#serverless) or [**Hybrid**](#hybrid) - to view what's next.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Serverless">

### Serverless

For **Serverless deployments**, there are two ways to deploy your code to Dagster+:

- [**Start from a template**](#use-a-template) - Use one of our quickstart templates to get up and running. All templates come with CI/CD already configured and will be cloned to a new GitHub repository.

- [**Import an existing project**](#import-an-existing-project) - Import an existing GitHub repository using our GitHub integration or the [dagster-cloud CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli). **Note**: If using the GitHub integration, Dagster+ will automatically set up CI/CD for you.

#### Use a template

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="GitHub">

##### GitHub

1. Click **Select** to select a template.
2. Sign in to your GitHub account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster+, define the following:
   - **Git scope** - Select the organization or account to create the new repository in.
   - **Repository Name** - Enter a name for the new repository.
   - Check the **Make git repository private** box to make the repository private.
4. When finished, click **Clone and deploy**.

When finished, [continue to Step 5](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="GitLab">

##### GitLab

1. Click **Select** to select a template.
2. Sign in to your Gitlab account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster+, define the following:
   - **Namespace** - Select the group or account to create the new project in.
   - **Project** - Enter a name for the new project.
   - Check the **Make git project private** box to make the project private.
4. When finished, click **Clone and deploy**.

When finished, [continue to Step 5](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

---

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

#### Import an existing project

If you have existing Dagster code, you can use Dagster's GitHub / Gitlab app or the `dagster-cloud` CLI.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="GitHub">

##### GitHub

Using the GitHub integration to import an existing GitHub repository also sets up CI/CD for you.

Before you get started, note that the repository must have a [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) in order for Dagster+ to deploy it. This file defines the [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) in your Dagster code.

If this file doesn't currently exist, create it in the root of your repository with the following code:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my_location_name # the name of the code location
    code_source:
      package_name: hackernews # the name of the python package associated with the code location
```

After you've committed the file to the repository, come back to Dagster+ to complete the import process:

1. Click the **Import an existing project** tab.
2. Sign in to your GitHub account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster+, define the following:
   - **Git scope** - Select the organization or account that the repository is in.
   - **Repository** - Select the repository.
4. Click **Deploy**.

When finished, [continue to Step 5](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="GitLab">

##### GitLab

Using the Gitlab integration to import an existing Gitlab project also sets up CI/CD for you.

Before you get started, note that the project must have a [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml) in order for Dagster+ to deploy it. This file defines the [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) in your Dagster code.

If this file doesn't currently exist, create it in the root of your repository with the following code:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: my_location_name # the name of the code location
    code_source:
      package_name: hackernews # the name of the python package associated with the code location
```

After you've committed the file to the project, come back to Dagster+ to complete the import process:

1. Click the **Import an existing project** tab.
2. Sign in to your Gitlab account, if prompted.
3. In Dagster+, define the following:
   - **Namespace** - Select the group or account that the project is in.
   - **Project** - Select the project.
4. Click **Deploy**.

When finished, [continue to Step 5](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="dagster-cloud CLI">

##### dagster-cloud CLI

<Note>
  <strong>Heads up!</strong> Using the <code>dagster-cloud</code> CLI requires a
  recent version of Python 3 and Docker.
</Note>

To complete this step using the CLI, add `dagster-cloud` as a dependency in `setup.py` in your Dagster code. For an example, see the [dagster-quickstart project](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-quickstart/blob/main/setup.py).

After you've finished setting up your local project, move on to deploying using the CLI:

1. To install the `dagster-cloud` CLI, run:

   ```shell
   pip install dagster-cloud
   ```

2. Next, you'll need to authenticate to Dagster+. Run the following command and follow the prompts to log in:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud config setup
   ```

3. After you've successfully authenticated, run the following to deploy your code to Dagster+:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud serverless deploy \
         --location-name "<LOCATION_NAME>" \       # name of the code loation
         --package-name "<PACKAGE_NAME>" \           # name of the Python package associated with the code location
   ```

When finished, [continue to Step 5](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>
</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Hybrid">

### Hybrid

To set up Hybrid deployment and deploy your code, you'll need to:

1. Set up an agent
2. Configure CI/CD for your project. We'll walk you through this in [Step 4](#step-4-configure-cicd-for-your-project).

For most Hybrid deployments - with the exception of those using a local agent - you'll need to create a Docker image containing your Dagster code and then add a code location to Dagster+ that references the image.

1. The dialog that displays will contain a pre-generated [agent token](/dagster-plus/account/managing-user-agent-tokens) and details about the agents currently supported by Dagster+.

   **Note**: Keep this token handy - you'll need it to set up CI/CD in the next step.

2. Follow the steps for setting up and deploying your agent:

   - [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](/dagster-plus/deployment/agents/amazon-ecs/creating-ecs-agent-new-vpc)
   - [Docker](/dagster-plus/deployment/agents/docker)
   - [Kubernetes](/dagster-plus/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuring-running-kubernetes-agent)
   - [Local](/dagster-plus/deployment/agents/local)

3. The dialog will indicate when Dagster+ receives an agent heartbeat. Click **Continue**.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-4-configure-cicd-for-your-project).

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

## Step 4: Configure CI/CD for your project

<Note>
  <strong>Skip to the next step if using Serverless.</strong> This step is only
  required for Hybrid deployments.
</Note>

To finish setting up your Hybrid deployment, you'll configure CI/CD for your Dagster project. How this is accomplished depends on your CI/CD provider:

- **GitHub** - If using GitHub, you can use our GitHub Action workflow to set up CI/CD for your project.
- **Another CI/CD provider** - If you're not using GitHub, you can configure CI/CD using the `dagster-cloud` CLI.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="GitHub Actions">

### GitHub Actions

To set up continuous integration using GitHub Actions, you can use your own Dagster code or the [Dagster+ Hybrid Quickstart](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart). The quickstart is a template with everything you need to get started using Hybrid deployment in Dagster+.

- **If using the template**, [clone the repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart).

- **If not using the template**, copy the GitHub workflow file (`.github/workflows`) from the [Hybrid quickstart repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/tree/main/.github/workflows) and add it to your repository. This is already done for you if using the quickstart.

**Configure the GitHub workflow YAML file as described below**. The GitHub workflow deploys your code to Dagster+ using these steps:

1. Initialize - Check out your code and validate `dagster_cloud.yaml`.

2. Docker image push - Build a Docker image from your code and upload it to your container registry.

3. Deploy to Dagster+ - Update code locations in Dagster+ to use the new Docker image.

**To configure the workflow**, follow these steps:

1. In the repository, set the `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN` GitHub action secret. This is the Dagster+ agent token from the previous section. Refer to the [agent tokens documentation](/dagster-plus/account/managing-user-agent-tokens#managing-agent-tokens) for more info.

   Refer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) for more info about GitHub Action secrets.

2. In your [`dagster-cloud-deploy.yml`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/blob/main/.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml), set the `DAGSTER_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` environment variable to your Dagster+ organization name.

3. In your `dagster-cloud-deploy.yml`, uncomment the step that is relevant to your Docker container registry. For example, if using DockerHub, you'd uncomment the `DockerHub` step in these files. Ensure you have set up the relevant secrets for building and uploading your Docker images.

After making the above changes and commiting the workflow file, the CI process should be triggered to deploy your GitHub repository to Dagster+. During the deployment, the agent will attempt to load your code and update the metadata in Dagster+. Once finished, you should see the GitHub Action complete successfully and also be able to see the code location under the **Deployment** tag in Dagster+.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Other CI/CD provider">

### Other CI/CD provider

For continuous integration using a CI/CD provider other than GitHub, your system should use the `dagster-cloud ci` subcommand to deploy code locations to Dagster+.

Ensure that you have created a `dagster_cloud.yaml` file as described in [the quickstart](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/). For detailed documentation about this file see the [`dagster_cloud.yaml` reference](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml). The following steps are typically implemented in the CI/CD workflow:

1. Set the build environment variables. Note that all variables are required:

   - `DAGSTER_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` - The name of your organization in Dagster+.
   - `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN` - A Dagster+ API token. **Note**: This is a sensitive value and should be stored as a CI/CD secret, if possible.
   - `DAGSTER_BUILD_STATEDIR` - A path to a blank or non-existent temporary directory on the build machine. This directory is used to store local state during the build.

2. Run the configuration check:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud ci check --project-dir=.
   ```

   This is an optional step but useful to validate the contents of your `dagster_cloud.yaml` and connection to Dagster+.

3. Initialize the build session:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud ci init --project-dir=.
   ```

   This reads the `dagster_cloud.yaml` configuration and initializes the `DAGSTER_BUILD_STATEDIR`.

4. Build and upload Docker images for your code locations.

   The Docker image should contain a Python environment with `dagster`, `dagster-cloud`, and your code. For reference, see the [example Dockerfile](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/blob/main/Dockerfile) in our quickstart repository. The example uses `pip install .` to install the code including the dependencies specified in [`setup.py`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/blob/main/setup.py).

   It is a good idea to use a unique image tag for each Docker build. You can build one image per code location or a shared image for multiple code locations. As an example image tag, you can use the git commit SHA:

   ```shell
   export IMAGE_TAG=`git log --format=format:%H -n 1`
   ```

   Use this tag to build and upload your Docker image, for example:

   ```shell
   docker build . -t ghcr.io/org/dagster-cloud-image:$IMAGE_TAG
   docker push ghcr.io/org/dagster-cloud-image:$IMAGE_TAG
   ```

   The upload step is specific to your Docker container registry and will require authentication. The only requirement is that the registry you upload to must match the registry specified in `dagster_cloud.yaml`.

5. Update the build session with the Docker image tag. For each code location you want to deploy, run the following command passing the `IMAGE_TAG` used in the previous step:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud ci set-build-output --location-name=code-location-a --image-tag=IMAGE_TAG
   ```

   This command does not deploy the code location but just updates the local state in `DAGSTER_BUILD_STATEDIR`.

6. Deploy to Dagster+:

   ```shell
   dagster-cloud ci deploy
   ```

   This command updates the code locations in Dagster+. Once this finishes successfully, you should be able to see the code locations under the **Deployments** tab in Dagster+.

**Note**: Creating Branch Deployments using the CLI requires some additional steps. Refer to the [Branch Deployments with the dagster-cloud CLI guide](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/branch-deployments/using-branch-deployments) for more info.

When finished, [continue to the next step](#step-5-set-up-environment-variables-and-secrets).

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Step 5: Set up environment variables and secrets

Congrats! At this point, your Dagster+ deployment should be up and running. To ensure the external services you use in your Dagster project work correctly, start setting up your [environment variables](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets). Using environment variables, you can securely pass in sensitive info like passwords, API tokens, etc.
