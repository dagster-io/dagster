# Dagster+ alerts

<ApplicableDagsterProduct />

Using Dagster+'s built-in alerting system, you can stay in the loop on the events occurring in your deployment. Dagster+ alerts integrate with several popular services, allowing you to deliver notifications when and where they're most needed.

---

## How it works

Alerts are created using **alert policies**. An alert policy defines [the conditions that will trigger an alert](#alert-policy-types) and [how the alert will be sent](#supported-notification-services). For example, you can create a policy that sends an alert to a Slack channel when any asset in a specific asset group fails to materialize.

Alert policies are configured on a **per-deployment basis**. This means, for example, that asset alerts configured in a `prod` deployment are only applicable to assets in that deployment.

### Alert policy types

            , an alert will only be sent after all retries complete.

            By default, asset checks that fail will have a severity of{" "}
            <code>WARN</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Alerts can be scoped to asset groups or specific asset keys. Asset check
        alerts are sent for any checks on those assets.{" "}

        you to send alerts to{" "}

          asset owners

      </td>
      <td>
        Triggers on job run success, failure, or time limit exceeded; may
        optionally include a set of configured tags. If an alert policy has no
        configured tags, all jobs will be eligible for that alert. Otherwise,
        only jobs that contain all the tags for a given alert policy are
        eligible for that alert.

        Each newly created organization starts with a long-running run alert
        policy, which sends an email to the email address used to create the
        organization when a job run exceeds 24 hours.

        falls below a specified threshold over a specified time window. This can
        be used to alert on:

          <li>
            Dagster credit usage across a deployment or for a specific job
          </li>
          <li>Performance regressions on asset or job runtime</li>
          <li>Spend on external tools such as Snowflake or BigQuery credits</li>

        Alerts can be scoped to the sum of any metric across an entire
        deployment, or for a specific job, asset group, or asset key.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Note</strong>: Alerts are sent only when the threshold is first crossed,
        and will not be sent again until the value returns to expected levels. Insights
        data may become available up to 24 hours after run completion.
