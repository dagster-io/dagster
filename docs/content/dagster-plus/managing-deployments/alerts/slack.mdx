# Slack & Dagster+

<ApplicableDagsterProduct />

Dagster+ supports [sending alerts](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts) to Slack channels using a Slack workplace app. Messages will be posted using a `@Dagster+` bot user.

---

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Permissions in Slack** that allow you to add apps to your Slack workspace
- **Organization, Admin, or Editor permissions in Dagster+**, which are required to create and manage alerts

---

## Step 1: Connect Slack to Dagster+

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.
2. In the top navigation, click **Deployment**.
3. Click the **Alerts** tab.
4. Click **Connect to Slack** and complete the installation process.

---

## Step 2: Add the Dagster Cloud bot to Slack channels

After the app is installed in your Slack workspace, you can add the `@Dagster Cloud` bot user to the channels where notifications should be sent.

You can do that by going into the channel settings, selecting the `Integrations` tab and selecting `Add an App`.

You can also make a post in a channel to the `@Dagster Cloud` bot user and you will be prompted to add it to the channel.

---

## Step 3: Create an alert policy in Dagster+

Creating an alert policy can be done using the Dagster+ UI or the `dagster-cloud` CLI and a YAML file.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="In the UI">

### In the UI

1. Create and configure an alert policy. Refer to the [Managing alerts in Dagster+ guide](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-in-ui) for more info.

2. In the **Notification Service** section of the **Create alert policy** window, select the **Slack** option.

3. In the field that displays, enter the name of the Slack channel you added the `@Dagster+` bot user to.

   **Note**: One channel is allowed per alert policy. To post alerts to multiple channels, first invite the `@Dagster+` bot and then create a new alert policy that posts to that channel.

4. Click **Save policy**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="dagster-cloud CLI">

### dagster-cloud CLI

To define a Slack alert policy in code, use the following keys to configure the alert:

- `notification_service.slack.slack_workspace_name` - The name of the Slack workspace connected to Dagster+
- `notification_service.slack.slack_channel_name` - The name of the Slack channel the `@Dagster Cloud` user is a member of

```yaml file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/slack_policy.yaml
# alert_policies.yaml

alert_policies:
  - name: "slack-alert-policy"
    description: "An alert policy to send a Slack notification to sales on job failure or success."
    tags:
      - key: "team"
        value: "sales"
    event_types:
      - "JOB_SUCCESS"
      - "JOB_FAILURE"
    notification_service:
      slack:
        slack_workspace_name: "hooli"
        slack_channel_name: "sales-notifications"
```

Then, use the `dagster-cloud` CLI to set the alert policies for the deployment:

```bash file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/cli_commands.yaml startafter=start_set_alerts endbefore=end_set_alerts
dagster-cloud deployment alert-policies sync -a /path/to/alert_policies.yaml
```

Refer to the [Managing alerts using the `dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-cli) guide for more information.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## Disconnecting Slack

To disconnect Dagster+ from Slack, remove the Dagster Cloud app from your Slack workspace. Refer to [Slack's documentation](https://slack.com/help/articles/360003125231-Remove-apps-and-custom-integrations-from-your-workspace#remove-an-app) for more info and instructions.

Once the app is removed, refresh the **Alerts** page in Dagster+ and the **Connect to Slack** option will be displayed.
