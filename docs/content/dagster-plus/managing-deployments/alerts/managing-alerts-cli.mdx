# Managing alert policies with the dagster-cloud CLI

<ApplicableDagsterProduct />

In this guide, we'll walk you through managing Dagster+ alert policies using the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli). Alert policies apply to a full deployment (ex: `prod`), not Branch Deployments.

**Don't want to work in code?** You can also define and set alert policies using the [Dagster+ UI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-in-ui).

---

## How it works

Alert policies are defined in a YAML file and then, using the `dagster-cloud` CLI, set for a deployment. The YAML file should contain a single top-level key (`alert_policies`) and contain a list of alert policy objects. For example:

```yaml file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/email_policy.yaml
# alert_policies.yaml

alert_policies:
  - name: "email-alert-policy"
    description: "An alert policy to email company executives during job failure."
    tags:
      - key: "level"
        value: "critical"
    event_types:
      - "JOB_FAILURE"
    notification_service:
      email:
        email_addresses:
          - "richard.hendricks@hooli.com"
          - "nelson.bighetti@hooli.com"
```

### Compatible event types

Only certain `event_types` can be specified together when using the CLI to create alerts. For example, multiple run-based event types can be included in the same policy, but attempting to include a tick event (such as `TICK_FAILURE`) will result in an error.

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **To install the `dagster-cloud` CLI.** Refer to the [`dagster-cloud` CLI reference](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli#installing-the-cli) for instructions.
- **Organization, Admin, or Editor permissions in Dagster+**, which are required to create and manage alerts
- **Optional**: If using an integration like [Microsoft Teams](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/microsoft-teams) or [Slack](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/slack) as a notification service, complete the integration setup before proceeding. Refer to the [Supported notification services](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts#supported-notification-services) for a complete list of integrations.

## Setting policies for a deployment

In this example, we'll configure an email alert when a job fails. This job, named `important_job`, has a `level` tag of `"critical"`:

```python
def important_computation():
    ...


@job(tags={"level": "critical"})
def important_job():
    important_computation()
```

1. First, define a list of alert policies in a YAML file. For example, the following policy listens for jobs with a tag of `level: critical` to fail:

   ```yaml file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/email_policy.yaml
   # alert_policies.yaml

   alert_policies:
     - name: "email-alert-policy"
       description: "An alert policy to email company executives during job failure."
       tags:
         - key: "level"
           value: "critical"
       event_types:
         - "JOB_FAILURE"
       notification_service:
         email:
           email_addresses:
             - "richard.hendricks@hooli.com"
             - "nelson.bighetti@hooli.com"
   ```

2. Next, use the following command to set the policies for the deployment:

   ```bash file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/cli_commands.yaml startafter=start_set_alerts endbefore=end_set_alerts
   dagster-cloud deployment alert-policies sync -a /path/to/alert_policies.yaml
   ```

---

## Viewing a deployment's policies

To list the policies currently configured on the deployment, run:

```bash file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/cli_commands.yaml startafter=start_view_alerts endbefore=end_view_alerts
dagster-cloud deployment alert-policies list
```
