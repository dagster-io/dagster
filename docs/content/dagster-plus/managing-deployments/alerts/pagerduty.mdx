# PagerDuty & Dagster+

<ApplicableCloudPlan />

Dagster+ supports [sending alerts](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts) to PagerDuty, which will automatically create a PagerDuty incident.

---

## PagerDuty & Dagster+ integration benefits

- Empower your team with real-time incident response by integrating Dagster+ and PagerDuty
- Notify on-call responders when alerts are triggered in Dagster+
- Dramatically reduce downtime for issues related to asset materialization, asset checks, job runs, schedules, sensors, and code locations
- Customize the urgency and routing of PagerDuty incidents based on the content of the Dagster+ event payload

---

## How it works

- Events that trigger an alert in Dagster+ will automatically create a PagerDuty incident
- Incidents can be triggered for events related to runs, assets, schedules, sensors, and code locations
- Users must resolve incidents in PagerDuty. Dagster+ doesn't currently automatically resolve incidents.

### Requirements

To integrate PagerDuty with Dagster+, you'll need:

- **Permissions in PagerDuty that allow you to manage services and integrations.** Refer to PagerDuty's [User roles](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/user-roles) documentation for more information.
- **The following in Dagster+**:
  - **A Pro plan**
  - **Organization, Admin, or Editor permissions**, which are required to create and manage alerts

## Integration walkthrough

### In PagerDuty

1. From the **Configuration** menu, click **Services > Service Directory**.

2. There are two ways to add an integration to a service:

   - **If adding your integration to an existing service**: Click the **name** of the service you want to add the integration to. Then, select the **Integrations** tab and click the **New Integration** button.

   - **If creating a new service for your integration**: Refer to PagerDuty's [Configuring services and integrations documentation](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-configuring-services-and-integrations) and follow the steps outlined in the [Create a new service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-create-a-new-service) section, selecting **Dagster+** as the **Integration Type** in step 4. Continue with the [**In Dagster+**](#in-dagster) section (below) once finished.

3. Enter an **Integration Name** in the format `monitoring-tool-service-name` (e.g. `dagster-plus-run-failures`) and select **Dagster+** from the **Integration Type** menu.

4. Click the **Add Integration** button to save your new integration. You will be redirected to the **Integrations** tab for your service.

5. An **Integration Key** will be generated on this screen. Keep this key saved in a safe place, as it will be used when you configure the integration with **Dagster+** in the next section.

### In Dagster+

Creating an alert policy can be done using the Dagster+ UI or in code.

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="In the UI">

#### In the UI

1. Sign into your Dagster+ account.

2. Create and configure an alert policy as per the [alert policy documentation](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-in-ui#creating-alert-policies).

3. In the **Notification Service** section of the **Create alert policy** window:

   1. Select **PagerDuty**.
   2. In the field that displays, paste the PagerDuty integration key you created in the previous section.

4. Click **Save policy**.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="dagster-cloud CLI">

#### dagster-cloud CLI

To define a PagerDuty alert policy in code, use the `notification_service.pagerduty.integration_key` key to provide the integration key. For example:

```yaml file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/pagerduty_policy.yaml
# alert_policies.yaml

alert_policies:
  - name: "pagerduty-alert-policy"
    description: "An alert policy to create a PagerDuty incident upon job failure."
    tags:
      - key: "level"
        value: "critical"
    event_types:
      - "AGENT_UNAVAILABLE"
    notification_service:
      pagerduty:
        integration_key: "<pagerduty_integration_key>"
```

Then, use the `dagster-cloud` CLI to set the alert policies for the deployment:

```bash file=/dagster_cloud/alerts/cli_commands.yaml startafter=start_set_alerts endbefore=end_set_alerts
dagster-cloud deployment alert-policies sync -a /path/to/alert_policies.yaml
```

Refer to the [Managing alerts using the `dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-cli) guide for more information.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>
