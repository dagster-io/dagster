# Integrating Snowflake & dbt with Dagster+ Insights

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster+ via an API.

If you use dbt to materialize tables in Snowflake, use this guide to integrate Snowflake metrics into the Insights UI. For instructions on integrating direct Snowflake queries, see [Integrating Direct Snowflake Usage with Dagster+ Insights](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster+ account on the Pro plan
- Access to the [Dagster+ Insights feature](/dagster-cloud/insights)
- Snowflake credentials which have access to the `snowflake.account_usage.query_history` table. For more information on granting access to this table, see the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage#enabling-the-snowflake-database-usage-for-other-roles).
- To install the following libraries:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagster-cloud dagster-dbt dagster-snowflake
  ```

  **Note**: If you already have `dagster-cloud` installed, **make sure you're using version 1.5.1 or newer**.

---

## Step 1: Instrument your Dagster code

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Using assets">

First, instrument the Dagster <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_assets" decorator /> function with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights`:

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import dbt_with_snowflake_insights


@dbt_assets(...)
def my_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    # Typically you have a `yield from dbt_resource.cli(...)`.
    # Wrap the original call with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights` as below.
    dbt_cli_invocation = dbt_resource.cli(["build"], context=context)
    yield from dbt_with_snowflake_insights(context, dbt_cli_invocation)
```

This passes through all underlying events and emits an <PyObject object="AssetObservation" /> for each asset materialization. The observation contains the dbt invocation ID and unique ID recorded in the Dagster event log.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using ops and jobs">

First, instrument the op function with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights`:

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import dbt_with_snowflake_insights


@op(out={})
def my_dbt_op(context: OpExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    # Typically you have a `yield from dbt_resource.cli(...)`.
    # Wrap the original call with `dbt_with_snowflake_insights` as below.
    dbt_cli_invocation = dbt.cli(
        ["build"], context=context, manifest=dbt_manifest_path
    )
    yield from dbt_with_snowflake_insights(context, dbt_cli_invocation)

@job
def my_dbt_job():
  ...
  my_dbt_op()
  ...
```

This passes through all underlying events and emits an `AssetObservation` for each asset materialization. The observation contains the dbt invocation ID and unique ID that are recorded in the Dagster event log.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

## Step 2: Update dbt_project.yml

Next, add the following to your dbt project's `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
query-comment:
  comment: "snowflake_dagster_dbt_v1_opaque_id[[[{{ node.unique_id }}:{{ invocation_id }}]]]"
  append: true
```

This allows you to add a comment, containing the dbt invocation ID and unique ID, to every query recorded in Snowflake's `query_history` table. Using this data, Insights will attribute cost metrics in BigQuery to the corresponding Dagster jobs and assets.

**Note**: Make sure to include `append: true`, as Snowflake strips leading comments.

---

## Step 3: Create a metrics ingestion pipeline in Dagster

The last step is to create a Dagster pipeline that joins asset observation events with the Snowflake query history and calls the Dagster+ ingestion API. Snowflake usage information is available at a delay, so this pipeline will run on a schedule to ingest Snowflake usage information from the previous hour.

Note that you only need to create this pipeline in a single code location per deployment, even if you have instrumented dbt assets in multiple code locations.

To do this, you'll need a Snowflake resource (<PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="SnowflakeResource" />) that can query the `snowflake.account_usage.query_history` table. You can set up the ingestion pipeline like the following:

```python
from dagster_snowflake import SnowflakeResource
from dagster import Definition, EnvVar

from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import (
    create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule,
)

snowflake_insights_definitions = create_snowflake_insights_asset_and_schedule(
    start_date="2023-10-5-00:00",
    snowflake_resource_key="snowflake_insights",
)

defs = Definitions(
  assets=[..., *snowflake_insights_definitions.assets],
  schedules=[..., snowflake_insights_definitions.schedule],
  resources={
    ...,
    "snowflake_insights": SnowflakeResource(
      account=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_ACCOUNT"),
      user=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_USER"),
      password=EnvVar("SNOWFLAKE_PURINA_PASSWORD"),
    ),
 }
)
```

In this example, the `snowflake_resource_key` is a <PyObject module="dagster_snowflake" object="SnowflakeResource" /> that has access to the `query_history` table.

Snowflake credit metrics should be available on the **Insights** tab in the Dagster UI after a short period of time (within 24 hours) of the ingestion job running:

<!-- ![Snowflake credits in the Insights tab of the Dagster UI](/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-snowflake.png) -->
