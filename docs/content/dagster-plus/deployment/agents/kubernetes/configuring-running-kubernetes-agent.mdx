# Configuring and running a Kubernetes agent

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster+.</Note>

In this guide, you'll configure and run a Kubernetes agent. Kubernetes agents are used to launch your code in Kubernetes Jobs and Services.

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Permissions in Dagster+ that allow you to manage agent tokens**. Refer to the [User permissions documentation](/dagster-plus/account/managing-users) for more info.

- **A Kubernetes cluster into which you can deploy the agent.** This can be a self-hosted Kubernetes cluster or a managed offering like [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/#overview), or [Google GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine).

- **Access to a container registry to which you can push images and from which pods in the Kubernetes cluster can pull images.** This can be:

  - A self-hosted registry,
  - A public registry such as [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), or
  - A managed offering such as [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/), [Azure ACR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/#overview), or [Google GCR](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)

- **To have Helm installed.** Refer to the [Helm installation documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for more info.

## Step 1: Generate a Dagster+ agent token

<GenerateAgentToken />

---

## Step 2: Configure the agent

In this step, you'll create a Kubernetes namespace for your Dagster+ resources. You'll also add the agent token to the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Create a Kubernetes namespace for your Dagster+ resources:

   ```shell
   kubectl create namespace <namespace>
   ```

   For example, if the namespace is `dagster-plus`:

   ```shell
   kubectl create namespace dagster-plus
   ```

2. Add the agent token you created in [Step 1](#step-1-generate-a-dagster-agent-token) as a secret in the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```shell
   kubectl create secret generic dagster-cloud-agent-token \
       --from-literal=DAGSTER_CLOUD_AGENT_TOKEN=<your_agent_token> \
       --namespace dagster-plus
   ```

---

## Step 3: Start the agent

In this step, you'll spin up the agent with Helm.

1. Add the [agent chart repository](https://dagster-io.github.io/helm-user-cloud):

   ```shell
   helm repo add dagster-cloud https://dagster-io.github.io/helm-user-cloud
   helm repo update
   ```

2. Create a `values.yaml` file, indicating the Dagster+ deployment the agent will be responsible for. **Note**: When your Dagster+ organization is first created, the default deployment is `prod`:

   ```yaml
   dagsterCloud:
     deployment: prod
   ```

3. Install the agent chart, specifying:

   - The namespace into which to install the chart
   - The `values.yaml` file created in the previous step

   ```shell
   helm upgrade \
      --install user-cloud dagster-cloud/dagster-cloud-agent \
      --namespace dagster-plus \
      --values ./values.yaml
   ```

After the Helm chart is installed into the Kubernetes cluster, you can view the agent in Dagster+.

In Dagster+, navigate to the **Status** page and click the **Agents** tab. You should see the agent running in the **Agent statuses** section:

<Image

## Next steps

Now that you've got your agent running, what's next?

- **If you're getting Dagster+ set up**, the next step is to [add a code location](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/code-locations) using the agent.

- **If you're ready to load your Dagster code**, refer to the [Adding Code to Dagster+](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/code-locations) guide for more info.

You can also further [configure the jobs the agent runs](/dagster-plus/deployment/agents/kubernetes/configuration-reference), including adding secrets, mounting volumes, and setting resource limits.
