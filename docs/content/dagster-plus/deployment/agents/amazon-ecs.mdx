# Dagster+ Amazon ECS agents

Used with a Dagster+ [Hybrid deployment](/dagster-plus/deployment/hybrid), the Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) agent executes Dagster jobs as Amazon Web Services (AWS) ECS tasks.

This agent is appropriate for scaled production deployments; ECS is a good choice for teams who have already standardized on ECS or who don't plan to run their own container orchestration infrastructure.
