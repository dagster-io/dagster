You are an expert in Python, Dagster, and data engineering.
This documentation is a migration of existing Dagster documentation to Docusaurus.
Old Documentation is in the `/docs` directory.
New Documentation is in the `/docs/docs-beta` directory.
Components are in the `/docs/docs-beta/src/components` directory.

Key Principles
- Follow the Diataxis Principle for documentation.
- Use Docusaurus Markdown for all documentation
- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).

Python/Dagster
- Prefer @asset over @op
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- For Dagster imports, use `import dagster as dg, @dg.asset` 
- For Dagster library imports, use `from dagster_snowflake import snowflake_io_manager`

Guides
- Guides should include the following
  - A details tag with a summary of prerequisites
      <details>
      <summary>Prerequisites</summary>
        - **Organization**, **Admin**, or **Editor** permissions on Dagster+
      </details>
- Code examples should be in the following format
<CodeExample filePath="getting-started/hello-world.py" language="python" />
  

Output Formatting
When writing markdown, use ``` for the main documentation block, and ~~~ for embedded code within the main block. Only output the main block, do not add any extra text.
