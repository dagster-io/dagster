# ##### PYLINT
# ########################

# Pylint has many options that are divvied up by category. Each [SECTION] below corresponds to a
# section in this doc:
#   https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/technical_reference/features.html 

# NOTE: Running pylint in parallel (i.e. -j/--jobs option != 1) currently will not work (with
# Dagster's configuration) on some platforms (specifically macOS, maybe others). This is because of
# the `dagster.utils.linter` plugin, which contains extensions that can't be properly pickled. There
# are open issues discussing this problem but it looks like the situation is likely to persist for
# some time:
#   https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/run.html#parallel-execution
