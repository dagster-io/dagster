  'Use Dagster and Weights & Biases (W&B) to orchestrate your MLOps pipelines and maintain ML assets. The integration with W&B makes it easy within Dagster to:\n\n- use and create W&B Artifacts\n- use and create Registered Models in W&B Model Registry\n- run training jobs on dedicated compute using W&B Launch\n- use the Weights & Biases client in ops and assets\n\nThe W&B Dagster integration provides a W&B-specific Dagster resource and I/O Manager:\n\n- `wandb_resource`: a Dagster resource used to authenticate and communicate to the W&B API.\n- `wandb_artifacts_io_manager`: a Dagster I/O Manager used to consume W&B Artifacts.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo use this integration you will need a Weights and Biases account. Then you will need a W&B API Key, a W&B entity (user or team), and a W&B project. Full installation details can be found on [the Weights and Biases website here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/dagster).\n\n**Note** that Weights & Biases do offer a free cloud account for personal (non-corporate) use. Check out their [pricing page](https://wandb.ai/site/pricing) for details.\n\n### Example\n\nA complete tutorial can be found on [the Weights and Biases website here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/other/dagster).\n\n### About Weights & Biases\n\n[Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) makes it easy to track your experiments, manage & version your data, and collaborate with your team so you can focus on building the best machine learning models.';
