  'The `dagster-qdrant` library lets you integrate Qdrant\'s vector database with Dagster, making it easy to build AI-driven data pipelines. You can run vector searches and manage data directly within Dagster.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dagster dagster-qdrant\n```\n\n### Example\n\n<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/integrations/qdrant.py" language="python" />\n\n### About Qdrant\n\nQdrant (read: quadrant) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage vectors with additional payload and extended filtering support.
