  'The `dagster-aws` integration library provides the `PipesGlueClient` resource, enabling you to launch AWS Glue jobs directly from Dagster assets and ops. This integration allows you to pass parameters to Glue code while Dagster receives real-time events, such as logs, asset checks, and asset materializations, from the initiated jobs. With minimal code changes required on the job side, this integration is both efficient and easy to implement.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dagster-aws\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom dagster_aws.pipes import (\n    PipesGlueClient,\n    PipesS3ContextInjector,\n    PipesS3MessageReader,\n)\n\nimport dagster as dg\n\n\n@dg.asset\ndef glue_pipes_asset(\n    context: dg.AssetExecutionContext, pipes_glue_client: PipesGlueClient\n):\n    return pipes_glue_client.run(\n        context=context,\n        job_name="Example Job",\n        arguments={"some_parameter_value": "1"},\n    ).get_materialize_result()\n\n\ndefs = dg.Definitions(\n    assets=[glue_pipes_asset],\n    resources={\n        "pipes_glue_client": PipesGlueClient(\n            client=boto3.client("glue", region_name="us-east-1"),\n            context_injector=PipesS3ContextInjector(\n                client=boto3.client("s3"),\n                bucket="my-bucket",\n            ),\n            message_reader=PipesS3MessageReader(\n                client=boto3.client("s3"), bucket="my-bucket"\n            ),\n        )\n    },\n)\n```\n        \n\n### About AWS Glue\n\n**AWS Glue** is a fully managed cloud service designed to simplify and automate the process of discovering, preparing, and integrating data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
