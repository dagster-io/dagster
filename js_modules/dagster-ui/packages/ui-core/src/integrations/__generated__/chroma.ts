  'The `dagster-chroma` library allows you to easily interact with Chroma\'s vector database capabilities to build AI-powered data pipelines in Dagster. You can perform vector similarity searches, manage schemas, and handle data operations directly from your Dagster assets.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dagster dagster-chroma\n```\n\n### Example\n\n<CodeExample path="docs_snippets/docs_snippets/integrations/chroma.py" language="python" />\n\n### About Chroma\n\n**Chroma** is the open-source AI application database. Chroma makes it easy to build LLM apps by making knowledge, facts, and skills pluggable for LLMs. It provides a simple API for storing and querying embeddings, documents, and metadata. Chroma can be used to build semantic search, question answering, and other AI-powered applications. The database can run embedded in your application or as a separate service.';
