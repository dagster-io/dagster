  "With this integration you can create a Open Metadata service to ingest metadata produced by the Dagster application. View the Ingestion Pipeline running from the Open Metadata Service Page.\n\n### About Open Metadata\n\nPoorly organized metadata is preventing organizations from realizing the full potential of data. Most metadata is incorrect, inconsistent, stale, missing, and fragmented in silos across various disconnected tools obscuring a holistic picture of data.\n\n**Open Metadata** is an all-in-one platform for data discovery, data lineage, data quality, observability, governance, and team collaboration. It's one of the fastest growing open source projects with a vibrant community and adoption by a diverse set of companies in a variety of industry verticals. Powered by a centralized metadata store based on Open Metadata Standards/APIs, supporting connectors to a wide range of data services, OpenMetadata enables end-to-end metadata management, giving you the freedom to unlock the value of your data assets.";
