### Running on AWS
The pipelines defined in this repository can run against a local Spark cluster
and Postgres instance, or they can run against a Redshift cluster and Spark
running on Amazon EMR.

We manage AWS resources with [pulumi](https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi).
First, install the pulumi CLI:

    brew install pulumi


Pulumi resources are divided by "project". To spin resources up for a demo run,
use the `demo_resources` project.

First, make sure you have the requirements. (You'll need to have already
installed TypeScript.)

    cd pulumi/demo_resources
    npm install

Then, you can bring up resources by running:

    pulumi up

This will take between 4 and 5 minutes.

To destroy resources, run:

    pulumi destroy

*Warning*: Currently we are unable to cleanly tear down the VPC using pulumi
because of dependency errors like the following:

    error: Plan apply failed: deleting urn:pulumi:demo_resources-dev::demo_resources::aws-infra:network:Network$aws:ec2/vpc:Vpc::airline_demo_vpc: DependencyViolation: The vpc 'vpc-01a7f7c286196cdc0' has dependencies and cannot be deleted.
        status code: 400, request id: 03a586f3-e17e-41e2-b5fd-c4275226df30

It's unclear whether this is an issue with pulumi/aws-infra or something else,
maybe the autogenerated EMR slave and master security groups (? -- but if so,
see https://github.com/pulumi/pulumi/issues/1691 -- or, if this is in fact an issue
with the underlying terraform provider, see https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/3465,
and many other issues suggesting the EMR resource in the AWS provider is not
fully mature). There is no good way to find out *which* dependency is causing
this error (generated in the AWS CLI), and no way to force delete dependencies
from the command line (See: https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1721,
https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=223412).

Right now the workaround is to wait for a timeout (about 15 minutes), then
manually delete the VPC from the console, which will force-delete dependencies.

### TODOs

- Wire ingest pipeline up to Redshift
- Add config option for local ingestion (Postgres)
- Add config option for Spark running on EMR cluster
- Add S3 bucket for data sources
- Add solid to download from S3
- Wire up unzip file solid
- Wire up Spark join
- Write sql_solid
