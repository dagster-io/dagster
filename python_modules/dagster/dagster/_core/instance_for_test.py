    """Creates a persistent :py:class:`~dagster.DagsterInstance` available within a context manager.

    When a context manager is opened, if no `temp_dir` parameter is set, a new
    temporary directory will be created for the duration of the context
    manager's opening. If the `set_dagster_home` parameter is set to True
    (True by default), the `$DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable will be
    overridden to be this directory (or the directory passed in by `temp_dir`)
    for the duration of the context manager being open.

    Args:
        overrides (Optional[Mapping[str, Any]]):
            Config to provide to instance (config format follows that typically found in an `instance.yaml` file).
        set_dagster_home (Optional[bool]):
            If set to True, the `$DAGSTER_HOME` environment variable will be
            overridden to be the directory used by this instance for the
            duration that the context manager is open. Upon the context
            manager closing, the `$DAGSTER_HOME` variable will be re-set to the original value. (Defaults to True).
        temp_dir (Optional[str]):
            The directory to use for storing local artifacts produced by the
            instance. If not set, a temporary directory will be created for
            the duration of the context manager being open, and all artifacts
            will be torn down afterward.
