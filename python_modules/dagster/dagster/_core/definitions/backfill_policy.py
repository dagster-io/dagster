    """A BackfillPolicy specifies how Dagster should attempt to backfill a partitioned asset.

    There are two main kinds of backfill policies: single-run and multi-run.

    An asset with a single-run backfill policy will take a single run to backfill all of its
    partitions at once.

    An asset with a multi-run backfill policy will take multiple runs to backfill all of its
    partitions. Each run will backfill a subset of the partitions. The number of partitions to
    backfill in each run is controlled by the `max_partitions_per_run` parameter.

    For example:

    - If an asset has 100 partitions, and the `max_partitions_per_run` is set to 10, then it will
      be backfilled in 10 runs; each run will backfill 10 partitions.

    - If an asset has 100 partitions, and the `max_partitions_per_run` is set to 11, then it will
      be backfilled in 10 runs; the first 9 runs will backfill 11 partitions, and the last one run
      will backfill the remaining 9 partitions.

    **Warning:**

    Constructing an BackfillPolicy directly is not recommended as the API is subject to change.
    BackfillPolicy.single_run() and BackfillPolicy.multi_run(max_partitions_per_run=x) are the
    recommended APIs.
