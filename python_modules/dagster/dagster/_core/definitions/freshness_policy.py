    """A FreshnessPolicy specifies how up-to-date you want a given asset to be.

    Attaching a FreshnessPolicy to an asset definition encodes an expectation on the upstream data
    that you expect to be incorporated into the current state of that asset at certain points in time.
    How this is calculated differs depending on if the asset is unpartitioned or time-partitioned
    (other partitioning schemes are not supported).

    For time-partitioned assets, the current data time for the asset is simple to calculate. The
    upstream data that is incorporated into the asset is exactly the set of materialized partitions
    for that asset. Thus, the current data time for the asset is simply the time up to which all
    partitions have been materialized.

    For unpartitioned assets, the current data time is based on the upstream materialization records
    that were read to generate the current state of the asset. More specifically,
    imagine you have two assets, where A depends on B. If `B` has a FreshnessPolicy defined, this
    means that at time T, the most recent materialization of `B` should have come after a
    materialization of `A` which was no more than `maximum_lag_minutes` ago. This calculation is
    recursive: any given asset is expected to incorporate up-to-date data from all of its upstream
    assets.

    It is assumed that all asset definitions with no upstream asset definitions consume from some
    always-updating source. That is, if you materialize that asset at time T, it will incorporate
    all data up to time T.

    If `cron_schedule` is not defined, the given asset will be expected to incorporate upstream
    data from no more than `maximum_lag_minutes` ago at all points in time. For example, "The events
    table should always have data from at most 1 hour ago".

    If `cron_schedule` is defined, the given asset will be expected to incorporate upstream data
    from no more than `maximum_lag_minutes` ago at each cron schedule tick. For example, "By 9AM,
    the signups table should contain all of yesterday's data".

    The freshness status of assets with policies defined will be visible in the UI. If you are using
    an asset reconciliation sensor, this sensor will kick off runs to help keep your assets up to
    date with respect to their FreshnessPolicy.

    Args:
        maximum_lag_minutes (float): An upper bound for how old the data contained within this
            asset may be.
        cron_schedule (Optional[str]): A cron schedule string (e.g. ``"0 1 * * *"``) specifying a
            series of times by which the `maximum_lag_minutes` constraint must be satisfied. If
            no cron schedule is provided, then this constraint must be satisfied at all times.
        cron_schedule_timezone (Optional[str]): Timezone in which the cron schedule should be evaluated.
            If not specified, defaults to UTC. Supported strings for timezones are the ones provided
            by the `IANA time zone database <https://www.iana.org/time-zones>` - e.g.
            "America/Los_Angeles".
