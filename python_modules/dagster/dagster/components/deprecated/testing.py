    """Create a lightweight sandbox to scaffold and instantiate a component. Useful
    for those authoring component types.

    Scaffold defs sandbox creates a temporary project that mimics the defs folder portion
    of a real dagster project.

    It then invokes the scaffolder on the component class that produces. After
    scaffold_defs_sandbox yields a DefsPathSandbox object.

    DefsPathSandbox has a few properties useful for different types of tests:

    * defs_folder_path: The absolute path to the defs folder where the component
      is scaffolded. The user can inspect and load files that the scaffolder has produced.
      e.g. (defs_folder_path / "defs.yaml").exists()

    * component_path: The relative path to the component within the defs folder. If not
      provided, a random name is generated.

    * project_name: If not provided, a random name is generated.

    Once the sandbox is created the user has the option to load the definitions produced
    by the component using the load method on DefsPathSandbox.

    By default it will produce the component based on the persisted `defs.yaml` file. You
    can also supply a component body to the load method to override the defs.yaml file with
    an in-memory component body.

    This sandbox does not provide complete environmental isolation, but does provide some isolation guarantees
    to do its best to isolate the test from and restore the environment after the test.

    * A file structure like this is created: <<temp folder>> / src / <<project_name>> / defs / <<component_path>>
    * <<temp folder>> / src is placed in sys.path during the loading process
    * The last element of the component path is loaded as a namespace package
    * Any modules loaded during the process that descend from defs module are evicted from sys.modules on cleanup.

    Args:
        component_cls: The component class to scaffold
        component_path: Optional path where the component should be scaffolded. It is relative to the defs folder. Defaults to a random name at the root of the defs folder.
        scaffold_params: Optional parameters to pass to the scaffolder in dictionary form. E.g. if you scaffold a component with dg scaffold defs MyComponent --param-one value-one the scaffold_params should be {"param_one": "value-one"}.
        scaffold_format: Format to use for scaffolding (default: "yaml"). Can also be "python".
        project_name: Optional name for the project (default: random name).

    Returns:
        Iterator[DefsPathSandbox]: A context manager that yields a DefsPathSandbox

    .. code-block:: python

        with scaffold_defs_sandbox(component_cls=MyComponent) as sandbox:
            assert (sandbox.defs_folder_path / "defs.yaml").exists()
            assert (sandbox.defs_folder_path / "my_component_config_file.yaml").exists()  # produced by MyComponentScaffolder

        with scaffold_defs_sandbox(component_cls=MyComponent, scaffold_params={"asset_key": "my_asset"}) as sandbox:
