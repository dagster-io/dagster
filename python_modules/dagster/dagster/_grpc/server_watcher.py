    """This thread watches the state of the unmanaged gRPC server and calls the appropriate handler
    functions in case of a change.

    The following loop polls the GetServerId endpoint to check if either:
    1. The server_id has changed
    2. The server is unreachable

    In the case of (1) The server ID has changed, we call `on_updated` and end the thread.

    In the case of (2) The server is unreachable, we attempt to automatically reconnect. If we
    are able to reconnect, there are two possibilities:

    a. The server ID has changed
        -> In this case, we we call `on_updated` and end the thread.
    b. The server ID is the same
        -> In this case, we we call `on_reconnected`, and we go back to polling the server for
        changes.

    If we are unable to reconnect to the server within the specified max_reconnect_attempts, we
    call on_error.

    Once the on_updated or on_error events are called, this thread shuts down completely. These two
    events are called at most once, while `on_disconnected` and `on_reconnected` may be called
    multiple times in order to be properly handle intermittent network failures.
