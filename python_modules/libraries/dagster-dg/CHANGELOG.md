# Changelog

## 0.1.16

- The entire dg CLI has been changed from noun-first to verb-first, e.g. dg code-location scaffold is now dg scaffold code-location.
- The `info` command has been renamed to `inspect`. Combining this change with the new verb-first orientation, `dg component-type info` is now `dg inspect component-type`.
