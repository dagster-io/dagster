    # same as the click completion script (nor is it compatible with a pure-click app). But the
    # typer automatic installation routine works for any completion script.
    #
    # Therefore, we:
    #
    # 1. Generate the click completion script and store it in a string.
    # 2. Overwrite the typer completion script, stored in an internal dictionary, with the
    #    click-generated one.
    # 3. Call the typer installation routine, which will then install the click-generated script.
    #
    # This is obviously hacky and non-ideal, but it works and is probably superior to maintaining
    # our own completion installation logic across shells.
