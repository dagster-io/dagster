# The [in-airflow] subpackage does not have a setup dependency on Airflow because

# However, to ensure a reliable test and tutorial setup, we pin a version of Airflow
# that is compatible with the current version of dagster-airlift for all supported
# versions of python.
# Eventually, we could consider adding a test suite that runs across different versions of airflow
# to ensure compatibility.
