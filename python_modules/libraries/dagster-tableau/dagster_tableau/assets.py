    Args:
        resource_key (str): The resource key to use for the Tableau resource.
        specs (Sequence[AssetSpec]): The asset specs of the executable assets in the Tableau workspace.
        refreshable_workbook_ids (Optional[Sequence[str]]): A list of workbook IDs. The workbooks provided must
            have extracts as data sources and be refreshable in Tableau.

            When materializing your Tableau assets, the workbooks provided are refreshed,
            refreshing their sheets and dashboards before pulling their data in Dagster.

            This feature is equivalent to selecting Refreshing Extracts for a workbook in Tableau UI
            and only works for workbooks for which the data sources are extracts.
            See https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_workbooks_and_views.htm#update_workbook_now
            for documentation.

    Returns:
        AssetsDefinition: The AssetsDefinition of the executable assets in the Tableau workspace.
