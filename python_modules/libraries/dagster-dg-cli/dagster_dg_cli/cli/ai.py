def _context_prompt(dg_context: DgContext):
    return f"""
This session was started via the Dagster CLI `dg`. The following context will help you work with the user to accomplish their goals using the Dagster library and `dg` CLI.

# Dagster

Dagster is a data orchestration platform for building, testing, and monitoring data pipelines.

# Definitions

The Dagster library operates over definitions created by the user. The core definition types are:

* Assets
* Asset Checks
* Jobs
* Schedules
* Sensors
* Resources

# Assets

The primary Dagster definition type, representing a data object (table, file, model) that's produced by computation.
Assets have the following identifying properties:
* `key` - The unique identifier for the asset.
* `group` - The group the asset belongs to.
* `kind` - What type of asset it is (can be multiple kinds).
* `tags` - User defined key value pairs.

## Asset Selection Syntax

Assets can be selected using the following syntax:
- key:"value" - exact key match
- key:"prefix_*" - wildcard key matching
- tag:"name" - exact tag match
- tag:"name"="value" - tag with specific value
- owner:"name" - filter by owner
- group:"name" - filter by group
- kind:"type" - filter by asset kind


# Components
An abstraction for creating Dagster Definitions.
Component instances are most commonly defined in defs.yaml files. These files abide by the following required schema:

```yaml
type: module.ComponentType # The Component type to instantiate
attributes: ... # The attributes to pass to the Component. The Component type defines the schema of these attributes.
```
Multiple component instances can be defined in a yaml file, separated by `---`.

Component instances can also be defined in python files using the `@component_instance` decorator.

# Project Layout

The project root is `{dg_context.root_path}`.
The defs path is `{dg_context.defs_path}`. Dagster definitions are defined via yaml and py files in this directory.

# `dg` Dagster CLI
The `dg` CLI is a tool for managing Dagster projects and workspaces.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Validation
dg check yaml # Validate yaml files according to their schema (fast)
dg check defs # Validate definitions by loading them fully (slower)

# Scaffolding
dg scaffold defs <component type> # Create an instance of a Component type. Available types found via `dg list components`.
dg scaffold defs dagster.asset # Create asset
dg scaffold defs dagster.job # Create job
dg scaffold defs dagster.schedule # Create schedule
dg scaffold component <name> # Create a new custom Component type

# Searching
dg list defs # Show project definitions
dg list defs --assets <asset selection> # Show selected asset definitions
dg list component-tree # Show the component tree
dg list components # Show available component types
```
* The `dg` CLI will be effective in accomplishing tasks. Use --help to better understand how to use commands.
* Prefer `dg list defs` over searching the files system when looking for Dagster definitions.
* Use the --json flag to get structured output.
