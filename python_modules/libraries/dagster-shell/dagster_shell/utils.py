    """Execute a shell script file specified by the argument ``shell_script_path``. The script will be
    invoked via ``subprocess.Popen(['bash', shell_script_path], ...)``.

    In the Popen invocation, ``stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT`` is used, and the combined stdout/stderr
    output is retrieved.

    Examples:
        .. literalinclude:: ../../../../../../python_modules/libraries/dagster-shell/dagster_shell_tests/example_shell_script_utility.py
           :language: python

    Args:
        shell_script_path (str): The shell script to execute.
        output_logging (str): The logging mode to use. Supports STREAM, BUFFER, and NONE.
        log (Union[logging.Logger, DagsterLogManager]): Any logger which responds to .info()
        cwd (str, optional): Working directory for the shell command to use. Defaults to the
            temporary path where we store the shell command in a script file.
        env (Dict[str, str], optional): Environment dictionary to pass to ``subprocess.Popen``.
            Unused by default.
        log_shell_command (bool, optional): Whether to log the shell command before executing it.

    Raises:
        Exception: When an invalid output_logging is selected. Unreachable from op-based
            invocation since the config system will check output_logging against the config
            enum.

        Tuple[str, int]: A tuple where the first element is the combined stdout/stderr output of running the shell
        command and the second element is the return code.
