# Temporary pins for example projects that install from PyPI.

# Dagster aims to take a minimalist approach to pinning. Occassionally,
# dependencies will release breaking changes. When this happens, we
# typically don't patch previously released versions of Dagster to
# introduce a pin. Instead, we aim to introduce a pin or a backward
# compatible fix in the next release of Dagster.

# We run automated tests to install the latest version Dagster from PyPI
# and verify that these example projects work. We use this file to
# temporarily introduce pins for these tests until the next version of
# Dagster is published to PyPI.
