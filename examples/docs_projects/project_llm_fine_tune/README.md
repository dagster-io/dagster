## Dagster Ã— OpenAI Fine-Tune Demo

Fine-tune a custom model to detect specific features from Goodreads data.

In this example project we show how you can write a pipeline that ingests data from Goodreads
with DuckDB and then generates features for modeling. You can then use this data to fine-tune
a model in OpenAI to identify that feature while also validating the model against the base
model is was built against.
