Your project is configured with `project.python_environment.active = true`, but the active
virtual environment does not match the virtual environment found in the project root
directory. This may lead to unexpected behavior when running `dg` commands.

    active virtual environment: /.../my-project/src/../.venv
    project virtual environment: /.../my-project/.venv

To suppress this warning, add "project_and_activated_venv_mismatch" to the `cli.suppress_warnings` list in your configuration.
