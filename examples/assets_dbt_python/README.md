# Dagster + dbt starter kit

This starter demonstrates using Python alongside a medium-sized dbt project. It uses dbt's [`jaffle_shop`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), [`dagster-dbt`](https://docs.dagster.io/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt), and [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

## Getting started

### Option 1: Deploying it on Dagster Cloud

The easiest way to spin up your Dagster project is to use [Dagster Cloud Serverless](https://docs.dagster.io/dagster-cloud/deployment/serverless). It provides out-of-the-box CI/CD and native branching that make development and deployment easy.

Check out [Dagster Cloud](https://dagster.io/cloud) to get started.

### Option 2: Running it locally

To download this example into your working directory, run:

```bash
dagster project from-example --example assets_dbt_python --name assets_dbt_python
```

To install this example and its Python dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Then, start the Dagster UI web server:

```
dagster dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the project.

### Changing the code locally

When developing pipelines locally, be sure to click the **Reload definition** button in the Dagster UI after you change the code. This ensures that Dagster picks up the latest changes you made.

You can reload the code using the **Deployment** page:

Or from the left nav or on each job page:

### Using environment variables and secrets

Environment variables, which are key-value pairs configured outside your source code, allow you to dynamically modify application behavior depending on environment.

Using environment variables, you can define various configuration options for your Dagster application and securely set up secrets. For example, instead of hard-coding database credentials - which is bad practice and cumbersome for development - you can use environment variables to supply user details. This allows you to parameterize your pipeline without modifying code or insecurely storing sensitive data.

Check out [Using environment variables and secrets](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets) for more info and examples.

### Adding new Python dependencies

You can specify new Python dependencies in `setup.py`.

### Testing

Tests are in the `assets_dbt_python_tests` directory and you can run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest assets_dbt_python_tests
```
