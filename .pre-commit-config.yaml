  # We need two instances of the black pre-commit hook because black can only run with a single
  # config, but we need different configs for docs_snippets and the rest of the repo due to
  # differing line lengths.
  hooks:
    - id: black-jupyter
      exclude: "examples/docs_snippets|snapshots/"
      # Make sure black reads its config from root `pyproject.toml`. This is necessary for commits
      # where all files share a common root with a pyproject.toml file. Black config will by default
      # resolve to this pyproject.toml, which will cause use of default line-length instead of the
      # length specified in the root config.
