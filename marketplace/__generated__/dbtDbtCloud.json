You can schedule them to run as a step in a larger pipeline and manage them as a data asset.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dagster-dbt\n```\n\n### Example\n\n\n```python\nimport os\n\nfrom dagster_dbt import dbt_cloud_resource, load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job\n\nimport dagster as dg\n\n# set the auth token as an env var for demo purposes\nos.environ[\"DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN\"] = \"abc\"\n\n# configure a resource to connect to your dbt Cloud instance\ndbt_cloud = dbt_cloud_resource.configured(\n    {\"auth_token\": {\"env\": \"DBT_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN\"}, \"account_id\": 11111}\n)\n\n# import assets from dbt\ndbt_cloud_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_cloud_job(\n    dbt_cloud=dbt_cloud,\n    job_id=33333,\n)\n\ndefs = dg.Definitions(assets=[dbt_cloud_assets])\n```\n        \n\n### About dbt Cloud\n\n**dbt Cloud** is a hosted service for running dbt jobs. It helps data analysts and engineers productionize dbt deployments. Beyond dbt open source, dbt Cloud provides scheduling , CI/CD, serving documentation, and monitoring & alerting.\n\nIf you're currently using dbt Cloud™, you can also use Dagster to run `dbt-core` in its place.
