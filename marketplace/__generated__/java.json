It has evolved from humble beginnings to power a large share of todayâ€™s digital world, by providing the reliable platform upon which many services and applications are built. New, innovative products and digital services designed for the future continue to rely on Java, as well. To get started with Java, see the [Java developer resources](https://dev.java/)."
