  "content": "The `dagster-weaviate` library allows you to easily interact with Weaviate's vector database capabilities to build AI-powered data pipelines in Dagster. You can perform vector similarity searches, manage schemas, and handle data operations directly from your Dagster assets.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dagster dagster-weaviate\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n\n```python\nfrom dagster_weaviate import CloudConfig, WeaviateResource\n\nimport dagster as dg\n\n\n@dg.asset\ndef my_table(weaviate: WeaviateResource):\n    with weaviate.get_client() as weaviate_client:\n        questions = weaviate_client.collections.get(\"Question\")\n        questions.query.near_text(query=\"biology\", limit=2)\n\n\ndefs = dg.Definitions(\n    assets=[my_table],\n    resources={\n        \"weaviate\": WeaviateResource(\n            connection_config=CloudConfig(cluster_url=dg.EnvVar(\"WCD_URL\")),\n            auth_credentials={\"api_key\": dg.EnvVar(\"WCD_API_KEY\")},\n            headers={\n                \"X-Cohere-Api-Key\": dg.EnvVar(\"COHERE_API_KEY\"),\n            },\n        ),\n    },\n)\n```\n        \n\n### About Weaviate\n\n**Weaviate** is an open-source vector database that enables you to store and manage vector embeddings at scale. You can start with a small dataset and scale up as your needs grow. This enables you to build powerful AI applications with semantic search and similarity matching capabilities.
