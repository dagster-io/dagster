It provides resources to interact with AWS ECR, enabling you to manage your container images.\n\nUsing this integration, you can seamlessly integrate AWS ECR into your Dagster pipelines, making it easier to manage and deploy containerized applications.\n\n### Installation\n\n```bash\npip install dagster-aws\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n\n```python\nfrom dagster_aws.ecr import ECRPublicResource\n\nimport dagster as dg\n\n\n@dg.asset\ndef get_ecr_login_password(ecr_public: ECRPublicResource):\n    return ecr_public.get_client().get_login_password()\n\n\ndefs = dg.Definitions(\n    assets=[get_ecr_login_password],\n    resources={\"ecr_public\": ECRPublicResource()},\n)\n```\n        \n\n### About AWS ECR\n\nAWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. AWS ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), simplifying your development to production workflow. With ECR, you can securely store and manage your container images and easily integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines. AWS ECR provides high availability and scalability, ensuring that your container images are always available when you need them."
